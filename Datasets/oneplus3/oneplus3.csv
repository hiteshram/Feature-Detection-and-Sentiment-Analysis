Oneplus3,4,23-Dec-16,"Kudos to One Plus...
One of the best android device available across the globe.

Pros:-

Ultra Fast charging
Body texture is awesome
Customization level at its best
Feel good device
Worth paying 28K
Camera quality is superb in day time
Fingerprint is just amazing

Cons:-

In case of 4G LTE, the battery gets discharge very quickly. Only last for 10-12 hours.
One plus needs to work on build updates.They should be frequent. Oxygen wrapper written is good but not the best like other UI's
Headphones are not shipped so one needs to be pay extra 2-3K for the same."
Oneplus3,3,26-Dec-16,"It's almost 4 months I am using it, the service centers are not very supportive , has some battery issues like it stays only for 18-24 hrs even if u don't use it. In speaker mode then voice is very less and u need to keep it in full volume to hear properly and there is a sudden dip in volume once u reach half , Other aspects it's really a good mobile considering the price , no warranty for parts and other things as there is only 10 days replacement warranty. But there is an additional damage warranty for 1 year, very sleek and attractive model."
Oneplus3,5,02-Oct-16,"If you have 30000 rupees and wondering what to buy I can instantly suggest/advise you to buy one plus 3 because this phone is a flagship killer of one plus company because of how great this phone is and actually I am doing this review from one of plus 3 and coming to the ravishing feature of the phone it comes with a 6GB RAM!!!!.... UFF and it includes dash charging or I would like to call it godspeed charge!!! Because I know that the advertising shows that in 30 min it goes from 0 to 60 percent.. I don't know if this is on average but... I swear I have experienced this phone going 0 to 90 percent!!!!! Crazy!! And the cam it included time lapse, manual mode, slow motion mode!! Awesome right... Honestly I don't remember how many mega pixels the camera is but I am sure the front is 8 and back is 16 megapixels( I am really giving it a blind guess) ..... And the back camera kind of protrudes out the back which would be okay if the back cam was in flow with the body of the phone ( not protruding) and the battery is awesome 60 percent of juice is enough to get through the day and the phone is super thin with an aluminum unibody which makes it a little slippery which makes me suggest you a great case for safety and most importantly they don't include earphones which also makes you to buy new earphone or use your old earphone if you are comfortable and that much Goliath RAM is useful for a gamer and it boasts a 64 GB memory with an non-expandable memory.... And it provides dual sim and most important of all the lightning fast fingerprint sensor..... Great innovation... Resulting in much greater phone"
Oneplus3,4,21-Oct-16,"It's one of the best/the best phones available in the market so far if you are not a brand conscious.its a brand of its own created by people.people's choice.unlike any company created brands.only a techie would know what I'm talking about.this is one of the best as of now
Making it simple for you peeps.
Pros
Overall looks. Slim.. excellent elegant.stylish.classy.
Performance never lagged at all.installed more than 80 apps n games.s peed is grt.
Clarity is awesome
Camera is very good not bad at all.
Technically great.

Cons
Didn't find any except.....if at all to say it's slim metallic body is a lil slippery on the move.
Few colors of only icons in the phone are a bit vibrant...ie red n blues
Bottom line excellent excellent phone by all means...trust me I've used Samsung and iPhones.i phone sucks rather. it's way way better than all the phones available in the market till date for the price.j just go for it"
Oneplus3,5,30-Oct-17,"I'm writing this review after one year of ownership, built quality is awesome. You can compare its performance with the horse power of the sports car.
Pros
Camera - crispy shots like dslr (1080p 60fps video is ultra smooth) Manual mode available, stability is awesome.
Screen - it has AMOLED display which you only get with expensive mobiles, difference between normal display and AMOLED is nomal display projects black areas as black pixels and AMOLED turns off the pixels for the black areas to achieve true black. To test this download some wallpaper with full dark background with some subject in the middle now turn off the lights and see it in the dark room, the area which has drak part - pixels won't light up only the subject in other color will be visible. It's saves battery and gives rich display experience.
Fingerprint sensor - it's so quick, it learns and adapts to your fingers when everytime you use them so it can be accurate.
Dash charging - out of charge no worries give it few minutes it won't let you down, one plus 3 got your back always, battery backup also very good.
Ram - you'll get 6 gb of ram, it's like blazing speed.
Cons
There are no such things."
Oneplus3,5,20-Oct-16,"Just what it says in the specs but a little twist ... The 6gb ram is not useable as only 4gb can be useable till now.. there is a root feature to unlock the 6gb ram but battery life may be damaged. But still I don't find any issues with the phone after two weeks .. just love the dash charge ... Love it... Excellent camera ... Thank God I didn't settle for oppo ...
Never settle ????.. Main part doesn't overheat... Although I would have loved a bit of extra battery... But still no issues... Software can be boring but it's completely bloatware free.. unlike Asus or Samsung..
I am completely in love with this phone...????
WiFi direct is old news on this phone but with NFC it's a lot better for banking and visa transactions...
Camera bump is a bother but with the right cover or op covers are just good especially sandstone black... Spigen to has the best covers for op3
The OP3 comes with a screen guard also.. I would suggest not to remove the cover .. believe me it's worth it... Although tempered would not be needed for gorila glass 4.. normal screen guard just feels right... Even though it's not a perfect fit....
So many customising and so much more to add.. Check YouTube for more ideas on this phone....."
Oneplus3,5,01-Jan-17,We Indians are hesitant to buy products from new companies but let me tell you One Plus 3 just impresses us with its features and its cool look ...... 6 GB Ram.... not a joke ... I reckon if you have a budget of 30 k then this is the phone you need to buy . Compare it with other phones ...this phone is far better . Please provide ear phones for one + 3 as we have paid so much for it.
Oneplus3,4,20-Oct-16,"After years of using blackberries and iPhones, I have just migrated into an Android phone now. This is my first Android phone. Actually I had developed an aversion towards Android just becoz the UI of Samsung phones. Now this is an wonderful experience..

1. Though it has been labelled as a flagship killer, my one feel good factor is the user interface. Superb!! Hasslefree and lightening fast.
2. Camera is top class.
3. Battery charging is phenomenal and moderate discharge. I am not a gamer. And I use frequently day in day out. Charging only once a day and it holds for the whole day for me. Zero to sixty in a jiffy say 20 minutes!! Wav!!
4. The cast option is lovely as am playing videos and movies and YouTube directly from phone to my smart TV with ease with out any lacking in the resolution.
5. With even low net speeds the speed of the phone is awesome.

1. My hand developed pain after using for an hour. May be bcoz of my new experience with 5.5"" phone
2. Call quality is OK. Voices in the calls are not clear as other flagship phones
3. Audio playing volume is low. Sound quality no where near the iphone say 5S. The maximum volume is still not enough for me as I am using iPhones earphones.
4. Though rear camera is good, front camera is only 7 out of 10
5. Call quality too 7 out of 10

My verdict:
For half of the price of any flagship phone, advise you not to have any second thought before buying this. Just go for it!!"
Oneplus3,5,29-Oct-17,"I have been searching for a good mobile more than two weeks. I have gone through all mobile reviews and testing. My search end with OnePlus 3, Trust me this is my best smartphone. 6gb RAM, light weight, 5.5 big screen, good battery life, dash charge and 16mp camera is unbeatable with this price tag. I installed many apps very quickly and browsed long time my mobile was not getting heat. Camera/Photo clarity is ultimate. User experience and features are amazing. I recommend you to buy this phone then you will feel awesome.

I was ensured not to buy any kind of heating/hanging/low performance mobile phone because I faced lot of personal problems.

Thank you Amazon and seller for a good product
Delivered within 48 hours with average packing please improve packing quality."

Oneplus3,4,08-Oct-16,"Guys, soft gold looks decent. Won't say much about the phone as so many people have already talked about its great features. Though I will highlight this that the delivery experience was unfortunately worse than any I have come across. Firstly, the delivery guy s number was switched off and I had no clue when the delivery would happen. I called Amazon 4 times that day and they too had absolutely no clue on this. Quite surprising to know Amazon has no control on their delivery services ! . Finally at 10pm or so I got an SMS saying the product is delivered - only to know that it's not !! Again called Amazon, and this time the rep told me to process a refund and banged the phone as he couldn't help with this mess - which amazon created.
Finally after 6 phone calls , I left it out for Amazon to figure out what needs to be done. Finally during lunch time, some guy delivered it to my office. Point being, if something goes wrong, you are really left at the mercy of the person speaking on phone ( who btw keep changing and you need to repeat the entire episode to them each time )"
Oneplus3,1,08-Apr-18,"Bad service provided by one plus we went for ear piece replacement and the service guy couldn't open the phone and applied more pressure and screen started blacking out. The service guy claimed that its water damage and looted the money for both screen and ear piece. this has had only happened because my father went to get it repaired. Fooling people if they dont know about it is wrong actually.....
No way i will go for One plus again and look at the way you are increasing the costs of the phone."
Oneplus3,5,25-Dec-18,It's a buy worth money it's been 3 yes I have been using it first I got one plus 2 for my brother then I got one plus 3 for my self then I got one plus 3t for wife and now latest I got one plus 6t for mother great great great mobiles plus best feature of one plus is their operating system updates it's just fantastic I have face recognition system been updated in my one plus 3. Batter charging time 0-100is 45min not more and battery life in normal use is more than 16 hrs till now that's amazing. And on top of it it's too much rugged till the time u actually want to break it it won't coz my phone has fallen n number of times from my pocket on road floor even stones etc but all ok just pick up dust it and use it. Till the time 5g is not coming when I will be forced to change my phone I am not changing it. Just love it have 2games more than1.4gb big I play then continuously and it runs for min 4hrs then. So if u invest in one plus it's worth it.
Oneplus3,1,16-Oct-17,"Bought this last year , worked fine till 10 months then it started giving problem , when receiving call or calling cant hear voice and also cant transmit any call, automatically switching off. And their service online or onsite are pathetic , they are so far not able to sort out the problem with the phone. Few days before went to their service centre in delhi and they loaded the software again and told me that problem was with the software and after usage of 3-4 hours it again started giving the same problem. Please be carefull their service centres are in metros only ,so everytime you have problem you have to travel alot to get it sorted and you will be lucky if they do it for first time , as same happened with me . I literally waited for more than one month to get an opportunity to travel to delhi for repair and failed . Now my warantee is also gone and now have to travel again . Useless product and services."
Oneplus3,5,22-Jan-17,"I dithered over buying it for over a month because I had my heart set on the Google Pixel. But the price point vis-a-vis performance won out and I got the OnePlus 3. I wanted it specifically in graphite so even after I decided to buy I had to constantly follow Amazon to see when it would be brought in stock. Only one one piece used to come back to stock and I finally caught this. The OnePlus 3 has a free accidental damage protection offer with Amazon and otherwise this plan is for 2K so that's why I got the 3 rather than 3T which doesn't have coverage.
The phone itself is glorious. I shifted to this after my Nexus 5 and the performance is so sweet. No lag to my admittedly amateurish usage. The camera is amazing, I manage to eke 16-18 hours of battery on decent usage, and everything works perfectly for now. It's only been a week so I have my fingers crossed that this will continue for a while.
No regrets for skipping on the pixel with this.
"
Oneplus3,1,07-Aug-17,"I am writing this review after almost one year of using the phone.

I experienced more of cons than pros for 1plus 3
- although company states that the screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass but there are no specifications or properties of this glass. A customer would expect this glass go be shatter free or scratch free. Here this glass will shatter one's thoughts. It cracks on a simple fall and does bear scratch on a normal utility.

Although the company brags about the high quality parts. But the sad reality is its most of components are quite inferior and do not have a good life cycle. The ear piece is high frequency fault bearing component.

The service centres are located very impractically. Mostly are in malls. You pay parking charges and also wait for long hours.

The service engineers are also trial and error type of people. With limited knowledge and customer handling experience they would blame you and recklessly give long dates to take back the product.

Over all its a bad experience of owing this phone. I now examined the market and came to conclusion that Apple and Samsung are much better phones. Another brand one could depend on would be Nokia. Rest are Ram Bharose phones...."
Oneplus3,5,11-Jul-16,Truly a great Flagship Killer...A 100 % genuine replacement for Samsung flagships Nd one shud always consider this phone before putting ur hard earned money on expensive flagships..Worth every penny..Was on of the first buyers on Amazon..
Oneplus3,5,10-Dec-17,"It bought it from the Amazon first I thought how a Chinese manufacturer gave competition to other flagship killer like Samsung,apple,HTC and so on.But I realised this phone is unbeaten and the OTP updates are receiving since.Firstly I managed it with ?? but the software is now Oreo and I like to thank OnePlus team for this great work and I must suggest others to buy this product i.e,Oneplus.I'm not a professional reviewer or the company.It's authenticated to buy this one.Thank you for reading this.I wish this will help anywhere else."
Oneplus3,4,19-Oct-16,"Omg! Just one look and you will forget phones like Iphone, samsung galaxy series. One plus delivered one of the best phone currently available on market at lower price. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and install over 300 apps just to check how well it performs. All thw high end games I switched between shows no sign of lag. Only disadvantages is it doesn't have stereo speakers! Sound quality is good but not best like alcatel and nexus series... Definitely worth buying just try ot for yourself!"
Oneplus3,1,22-Feb-18,Guys i have bought this Phone in 2016. The phone worked as a beauty but meanwhile all of a sudden the mother board stopped working and i got it replaced free of cost. Then the phone stopped working properly. Turns on and off every bloody hour and its so annoying.. Spending 28000 and not even working well for a couple of hours is horrible. I wish we go back to the Old Golden NOKIA 1100 and NOKIA 3310 days..
Oneplus3,4,10-Oct-16,"Excellent smartphone, Dash charger charges battery very fast. Practically very useful for daily lifestyle of smartphone usage.
Pros.
Dash charge very fast charging
6 gb ram now way of slowing
Lag free Oxygen Os.
Good AMOLED display and camera quality in this segment.
Good call quality.

Cons.
Since, usb type c is not widely available, you need to bring your charger + cable for fast charge or micro usb adapter for normal charge.
Micro usb adapter has charging + data transfer compatibility but it doesn't have backward compatibility of micro usb otg. You have to buy separate usb type c otg.

Giving 4 star because of packing and packaging protection. It should have been better.

Overall OnePlus 3 is good choice for daily usage"
Oneplus3,4,06-Dec-16,"A great phone and a great device by OnePlus. Been using the phone for a month now and I'm pleased with the performance. The call quality is also very good. Using two 4G SIMS (Jio + Reliance) and both are performing well. Also has VOLTE support on both the SIM slots.
The 64 GB storage is more than enough for your data storage needs and apps so not missing the exclusion of a expandable memory card slot. Camera performance is also great. The only thing that I'm not too happy about is the battery life. But with dash charging I've made my peace.
With the OnePlus 3T having a bigger capacity battery, this should no longer be an issue. But I do hope that we do get a power bank pretty soon which supports Dash Charging.
Overall a great purchase. Was disappointed with the delivery from Amazon on this one though"
Oneplus3,5,13-Nov-18,"Oneplus 3 is one of the best phone for the price. Everything except the camera is of premium quality. It has super fast processing speed, has good space. Rear camera is good (except for low light) but the front camera is pathetic.
Best feature of the phone is dash charge, although the cable quality is doubtful, I've changed 2 cables in 2 years. The cables were in best shape, no cut, no internal cut, no bending, just some problem with type C port which connects on phone side, it just stopped dash charging, non-dash charging and PC connectivity working fine though."
Oneplus3,4,22-Dec-16,"No doubt, this phone is really good. First things first, I could not give it one star as I have been using Oneplus One earlier and I miss certain software features. Sometimes, it could be as simple as direct entry as soon as you finished pressing last digit of your code. I hope they will try to work on these things in due course of time. The speed is very good including unlocking with the fingerprint sensor.

The only grudge with Oneplus that I have is that I mistakenly ordered (confusing presentation on phone of their website of availability) white coloured curved screen protector and they are not ready to replace it with black one. I didn't open the package as well. In today's world, it seems strange and selfish way of treating a loyal customer (buying second phone). Well, not left with any choice I am selling it online now on olx (bengaluru) for 1449/-. If anyone interested, can let me know with a comment below."
Oneplus3,2,29-Dec-16,"I have used One Plus 1 and now using One Plus 3
One Plus gives great specifications at low price. however as far as longetivity is concerned, One Plus phones are prone to hardware problems. Check for ""one plus 3 camera focus issue""
You will find many people facing this hardware problem subsequent to 2 -3 months use.

In my case I stay at Kota, Rajasthan and nearest service station is 250km away at Jaipur.

Next time no use & Throw One Plus models."
Oneplus3,2,18-Dec-16,"I have used this for exactly 3 months and switched to SAMSUNG. Want to know why? - Read below:

They use Fake Gorilla Glass 4. But they advertise it as Gorilla glass. Do not believe.

The Phone is elegant, superb and has excellent performance. BUT Downside is - its very Fragile. I accidentally dropped it from 1.5 ft and thats it. The screen got infinite cracks. I then laughed at myself for buying a cheap part - flagship chinese phone called one plus 3.

I personally visited the Koramangala One plus exclusive centre. All they have is one answer for you - sorry sir, we don't have the parts for replacement. visit us later. One plus is focussing on their 3T device now. so customer desk himself told me they are not manufacturing the one plus 3 parts. Even the China Hub doesn't have these parts for shipment. I returned back with no solution in hand.

Guys - Be careful when you're buying a chinese brand. Especially once one plus 3 falls and breaks, that s it. Its history.
You guys Pay too much and getting such a delicate phone which cannot withstand even 1 feet fall. The battery backup is no match with other phones. It doesnt even last one full day.

Verdict: Have your eyes open, when going for a chinese brand, dont just see the specs - look at the customer service also"
Oneplus3,4,01-Nov-16,"for those who dont know, the mbile screen has a fade or gradient in the display screen colour
its very subtle in apps, almost barely visible
but in 'dark mode' its very visible when you drop down the notifications panel
just a know issue about the phone
also, dash charge may charge your device rapidly, but dont expect battery to last all that long as expected
ram heavy apps drain battery quite fast

apart from this, the phone is amazing
right on par in performance with high end phones like the galaxy s7"
Oneplus3,5,25-Oct-16,"Amazing Beast..Initially had battery drain issues then disabled few battery hogging apps..managed to get 5 hrs SOT...Although average battery with all apps always running in background is anywhere between 3-4 hrs SOT...just happy with this purchase...Just go for it if your budget is anywhere close to it... Bad delivery experience from Amazon ..the service of amazon is just going on deteriorating..The Box is received was bent from edges...Its just that I had no option than Amazon else I would have prefer other sites..

Ill would recommend Tarken Soft Back case with this Beast..Good Luck with this Beast :)"
Oneplus3,4,04-Jul-18,I like product in new condition not single dent or scratch on the external body panel and product not look like in refurbished category I feel like I purchase new mobile and this time I don't have any dislike I am happy with product and camera picture quality product performance is very good basically I got decent second hand product from vipul and he exactly send me same product he mentioned at the time of selling this product on amazon amazon did the good job and thank u amazon full fill my expectations as per this phone is concerned
Oneplus3,4,24-Oct-16,"Build quality is truly awesome: The general feel of the device is great. It’s only 7.4mm thick, which feels quite thin and it's a joy to hold

Dash Charging is a game changer can't believe it charges 0 to 60 in just under 30 minutes and you can charge at full speed even when the phone is being used.

Some apps like Snapchat usually lags a lot on Oxygen OS compared to other Android OEM that's why I am giving a 4 star rating otherwise it's a total value for money."
Oneplus3,4,03-Jul-17,"I really am in love with this phone.. I'll be celebrating it's one year birthday this month-July and till date I've no complaints with it at all.
The only major drawback is that it's too delicate! I dropped my phone in the first month without any cover on it and *puffff* . It fell side ways and the volume button got a dent making it impossible to use the button...and that's not it! I threw the phone second time too in the same month and *bummm* the screen's glass broke. That made me pay 8k for a screen replacement.Well , my bad- I didn't put on a case immediately. Other than the phone's delicacy, it has got no flaws."
Oneplus3,1,07-Oct-16,I bought thus phone exactly one month back. It worked perfectly fine till yesterday where I've come across a Software problem in this phone. When people try to call me my phone rings but it does not show on my screen so I'm not able to pick or even swipe. How can such an expensive phone have such a bad software. I've tried all ways of fixing it online. I've had to format my phone now to try and fix this.
Oneplus3,3,20-May-17,mobile was very good. but it has really disappointed me because within six months it started getting heated & was not working. Battery is getting drained within an hour.
Oneplus3,5,05-Dec-16,"I love it for its feature and performance. It's sleek, fast, battery back up and an amazing phone. I use it with so many apps and it never hangs. The best part is the dash charger which just takes less than 30 mins to charge the phone to full.. And you are ready to go for a day. It will not disappoint you. Better than all Samsung, Motorola etc any day.
Cons. The camera could have been better with better features like pause video recording."
Oneplus3,4,19-Oct-16,"The phone is just more than worth its price. I have used I-Phone 6s before dis and that sucked. iPhone is just not meant for India's IT structure. Positives great battery, dash charging (20-30 mins from 10 to 90%), very good look, light weight, super fast RAM, etc. Negatives: camera quality is not great despite being a 16Mp camera, the quality of photos in low light is very poor. Front camra doesn't have a flash (big negative). Overall I feel its a great phone except for the camera which is a little substandard as against the 50k phones. Why i compare it with expensive phones is because it beats them in all the other aspects."
Oneplus3,5,08-Oct-17,"This is 1st time I felt to write something about Gadgets I buy.
One Plus 3
Truly... It's fab.. Speed... No lags AT ALL.. High end games runs smooth... Apps as well....
Moreover... ""DASH CHARGE""... Trust me.. It's lighting fast (Don't go as words). It does charge from 0-60 in 15 Mins. 0-80 in 20 Mins. 0-100 in 35 Mins. Grab it.. it's worth..

About Amazon: you guys sucks.. delivery is very poor.. but one plus 3 gave me satisfaction to cover up."
Oneplus3,5,17-Oct-17,"Beast of a phone. Not a single point against one plus 3.camera is outstanding, it outperforms any other phone.so much details even after zooming in pictures. Whooping 6 geegs of ram. All apps open before u can even blink ur eye.one pro tip.- turn down all animations by going into developer options,once u turn of all 3 animation tabs, phone goes even faster.it takes u In another level of performance which no other company cud deliver.no lags what so ever.blink of an eye. Oxygen o.s. is butter smooth, so much customization. Wow u will be amazed to c dat u can even choose to have on screen button or no. More to come soon. Der is so much to write ."
Oneplus3,4,24-Oct-16,"SUPER PHONE. No complains. Using it to topmost extents..!
Instrument is great..!

Suggestions and area of rectifications can be:
Many Software accessible option are missing.!
for e.g.
1.You cannot add more names of recipients while text messaging, once you have types the letters in text area..?
2. Cannot find option to increase text message font size..(anybody please help)
3. Cannot make permanent folders in Gallery. Once you delete photo from main folder in gallery, it automatically gets deleted from folder created also.!?

Many more area of software improvement"
Oneplus3,4,30-Dec-16,"This phone is brilliant - the performance of phone is phenomenal. Have been using it for a month and not once have I regretted my decision. It looks classy, feels like a premium phone and is really fast. From multitasking to gaming, it handles pretty much everything with ease. The camera is good too - it takes brilliant pictures even in dark conditions. One Plus 3 is really a notch up than most of the other phones.

The only concern I have is the Type C USD charger, its not standard yet and in case you forget your charger, you wont get easily, So make sure to have a spare charger or your carry your charger with you wherever you go. Having said that, the battery performance is pretty good. It goes for a full day with a single charge and the dash charge tech, charges the phone in an hour."
Oneplus3,5,17-Sep-17,"Stupendous Fantastically fantasticcreates magical....
awesome phone,loved it
Now that’s what I call a performance."
Oneplus3,5,21-Sep-16,"It's been nearly 3 weeks now after using Oneplus 3 and defintely u will not regret for buying this beast. Almost every review posted here is genuine.
Seriously guys in terms of Hardware Oneplus rocked whereas in software there were some trouble. But guys those are delaying in buying Oneplus 3 because of software change that decision and buy Oneplus 3 rite now. Oneplus Software team has fasten their process and u won't believe approximately once in 8 days there are updates released in community build which keeps on solving all software related issues batch by batch. One thing that defintely changed me is that the way I charge my phone which you will also feel when u buy it. You might have heard fast charging dash charging with in 1 hour. Without using that feature physical u will never understand. Once u use that u will be amazed. Only thing is that Oneplus 3 should be used with a snap on cover which protects camera even though Oneplus states that it has a scratch resistance coating using it with cover is advisable in my opinion"
Oneplus3,3,13-Oct-16,"Update aftet one week of use:

Now its just 4 Hours Battery Life. ????????????

I have used One Plus 2, I had Good Experinace.I am using One Plus 3 Just for a Day. Basic Experinace same like One Plus 2. But One Plus 2 Naver hanged. But One Plus 3 already hanged Once. and Battery Drained in 10 Hours. Not Expected this. I thought it will be great phone. Its Didnt even recognize through Cable to PC"
Oneplus3,4,02-Nov-16,"Like most of you, i was very confused about which phone to buy, and aftwr weeks of research, i opted for oneplus 3,and hands down its one of the best phones out there. You wont regret buying it. Its functions smoothly. The 6 GB ram is more than enough, 2 gb is always unused. The camera is pretty decent, you went get the quality of a s6 or s7 but hey! They cost 20k more. There is no lag whatsoever. Should've had a more powerful battery, but then, you have the dash charger to compensate, and its blazing fast. Go for it without thinking if your budget is till 35 k.
Do buy a back cover though. This phone is slippery as ice. CHEERS.
Im not giving a 5 star as the product box was bent around the edges due to poor handling of the product."

Oneplus3,4,27-Sep-16,"Nice phone for all stuff loaded at the price. But display consumea lot of battery. Qudcor process a bit slow. Default encrypted, and 3-4 gb already consumed constantly. If you install a Antivirus software ot tells some qalcome fix is required which sti not patched in os release. I had bad experience playing candy crush where the phone was hanging. But i like the design and make. Overall a good phone at the price it is sold."
Oneplus3,5,12-Jan-17,"Purchased the handset after going through various reviews on definitive websites. Have no regrets whatsoever as the combination of looks, premium build and stellar performance and killer pricing leave you questioning the sanity of people buying flagships that are twice as expensive!
Suggest going through the review on GSM arena for detailed description.
Unless you are an absolute stickler for latest specs or in need of additional storage in excess of the user available 54GB, you don't need to pay the premium for a 3T also"
Oneplus3,5,05-Dec-16,The best thing I love about this phone is the UI. Unlike other brand phones the UI resembles stock Android with very little bloats and useful customisations. The camera is perfect for me. Takes quality pics - both rear and front.! The phone is a beast when coming to performance. Handles day to day tasks in a very efficient and smooth manner sans any stutter. One piece of tech I absolutely love.
Oneplus3,3,13-Jul-17,"I have been using this since September 2016

1. Battery backup: 2 star, Poor hardly runs 10 hour in stand by mode if you are taking 10-15 minutes calls, 20-30 minutes music play and screen on for 30 minutes. Even draining not stopped after putting this on airplane mode.
2. RAM : 4 star, 6 GB RAM is good in this price range at that moment, but sometimes got hang while playing Asphalt8.
3. Camera: 4 star, Only camera of this phone make me happy.
4. Sensors: 2 star, I used Lenovo K3 note, which sensors were far much better than this.
5. Body look and robustness: 4 star, nice look and robust."
Oneplus3,5,12-Jan-17,"A few months on, I have been very pleased with this phone. Blazing speeds, with no discernable lag. Great picture quality. A bit concerned by the build quality of the charging point at the bottom of the phone but I don't have to charge very often and for very long so possibly not an issue. Also some concerns about the cost of additional Dash charger and cable. Not readily available in the market so I have to think ahead and always have to ensure to carry the cable when traveling. Keeping fingers crossed that this phone serves me for a good period of time and that I don't have to test oneplus after-sales service!"
Oneplus3,4,10-Nov-16,"Well, this phone gets 4 stars just because of its high ram which makes it lag-free to a very great extent.
If you are looking for any other specs other than this, and camera, try some other phones as well. Otherwise, this is the perfect choice available at an extremely fair price.
However, if you have been a Samsung user of a high-end phone or an i-phone user, rethink on the decision. The quality of the phone is not up to that mark. Also, if you are buying for your professional use, carry a portable charger always with you! This is because the phone need to be charged ATLEAST twice a day, COMPLETELY. Though the battery is 3000 mAh, it doesn't live up to the mark.
For students, this is a perfect choice as graphics and space is awesome.
Apart from battery, there are many other tiny factors as well which are absent in this phone. One of them is that the inbuilt music player doesn't have options for changing the sound-effects. Another one is that the camera doesn't have option for lower the resolution of the image/video.Obviosly, there are apps that can compensate for it but they dont give the same level of satisfaction as the in-built apps."
Oneplus3,4,11-Nov-16,"Wow. i am blown off by the Value for money this phone gave me.
I was a strict nexus user before this and was waiting for the Google Pixel launch but when I heard the price at which the Pixel was announced, I said ""No thanks"", and went ahead and ordered this piece.

Oneplus 3 is in no way less than the other flagship phones of different manufacturers, in many areas it is much more than the others, be it snappiness/performance, Looks, display quality etc. Its even better than Iphone 6s in terms of display and performance.

Display is much better than the regular IPS and retina displays. I recommend you to put an iphone and Oneplus3 side by side and run this video from youtube: ""Landscapes 4K"" you will immediately see the difference.

The battery life is amazing, I charge it for half hour and it easily runs through the day. I charge it for an hour and it will easily last 2 days in normal use.

Camera is snappy, very quick in taking pictures and the OIS makes the pictures blur free. I would recommend everyone to shoot in raw and use apps to process those pictures, the results will be amazing.

Call quality and mobile internet is amazing, I have a Jio sim and things get downloaded with the blink of an eye.

One downside is the WiFi as it tends to loose signals sometimes. I saw online that this is due to some software issue with marshmallow and I hope it is fixed soon.

The design looks too good in hand. Feels very premium."
Oneplus3,3,29-Sep-16,"After doing many research bought this phone and using since last night but it comes with small bug, phone not ringing for incoming calls sometimes. You have to restart phone. One plus 3 should look into this and requesting Amazon to escalate this problem to One Plus 3 technical division as this phone is exclusively available through Amazon only. Hope will get solution at earliest."
Oneplus3,5,03-Oct-16,"The BEST among the rest.
First I'd like to thank Amazon and the seller for giving me this product on time.
3 days review(03/10/2016). will give a detailed review after a months of use.
Packaging: 4/5 : Packaging was not as par as it used to be. The box had few bumps, but the product inside was intact.
Display: 4/5 : Very good and vibrant display.
Camera : 3.5/5 : both front and back cameras takes good pictures. very good color reproduction. OIS not working at all while recording video.
Call quality: 4.5/5 : been using it outdoors and indoors not faced any call drops. and call quality through the micro phone and speaker is very clear.
Audio: 4/5 : this phone produces one of the best audio quality through headphones. but need to download 3rd party music app to enjoy the sound quality. audio from speaker is not bad.
Battery: 3.5/5 : battery will last upto max 1 day, I am not a gamer but still I had to charge this phone twice a day. My routine(browsing,youtube,facebook,calling).Dash charging works like a charm.

All in all one of the best !!!"
Oneplus3,4,14-Nov-16,"the phone is pretty nice for the price,initially i was going for nexus 6p 64 gb bcoz of bigger battery but since its launch nexus 6p has been for same price i.e 40k in india ..if a company doesnt care about price then why should i cae about that company..so i got this phone for my sister as a diwali gift.she loves the camera ! and she was surprised by dash charge ...she broke her iphone recently and she is new to android eco system and shes very happy with the switch..kudos to amazon for colab'in with one plus. for 28k you cant go wrong with this beast."
Oneplus3,4,22-Oct-16,"The product was good 6GB RAM 64GB internal memory powered by Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 Oxygen OS Version 3.2.7.Dual nano-SIM dual-standby (4G+4G) with NFC enabled and reversible type-C connector with Battery 3,000 mAh lithium-polymer battery (non-removable) which run for approximately 8 hours on continuas minimum apps uses. But the Dash Dash Charge technology as stated is good. In my case the battery charges from 32% to 100% in 47 minutes.
The delivery was made after 12 days though the scheme was under one day delivery. I ordered on 5/10/2016 and delivered on 16/10/2016"
Oneplus3,5,23-Sep-16,"Amazon treats prime customers request well. Really glad got my phone within two days. One plus 3 is the best android smart phone right now. More than specifications the phone prove to have best memory management and I have felt the never before experience with this phone since I'm using one plus brand for first time. Worth spending extra money with this great phone than compromising with poorly built smart phone. One plus stick to their moto of never settle. Even though the only cons are 3000mah battery and not having a 2k screen, I personally don't go with 2k resolution in 5.5"" screen and battery simply won't drain unless you power use it by playing heavy games. Also, dash charger proves to be a life saver with which you could always roam around with more than 70% charge left in your phone. One plus just slapped every other smart phone right on their face. Waiting for one plus 4 <3"
Oneplus3,5,07-Feb-17,"Though relatively new to the market, One Plus products won the hearts and confidence of the customers. The Chinese mobiles are much cheaper when compared to the market leaders. However One Plus 3 is priced a little higher than the other Chinese models. The 6 GB RAM of the phone may defend that pricing. Customers who like large downloads may appreciate the RAM utility."
Oneplus3,4,21-Nov-16,"Pros:true speed felt,awesome focusing in camera,design is too classy,one of the best finishing o have ever come across on a phone, the customisation capability is at the top level,front camera beats your iPhone 5s main camera(previous owner),various other features like dual Sims comes in handy,and the dash charging is just amazing
Cons: battery falls on the lesser side since it supports a 5'5"" 1080p display, the unaccounted filling up of the 6gb ram, little slippery with hands on"
Oneplus3,4,19-Dec-16,"It is an excellent phone. No doubts about it. I bought just before 3T was launched, but you know considering the upgrades aren't major, I am just fine with my one plus 3. The phone is super fast in almost everything.

The one challenge I have noticed is on Google maps. For some reason, there is significant lag and that just screws up the whole thing when you are using it on a real time basis. Don't know if this is an issue only with my device, but it surely is a problem. The other one which is an issue is the fingerprint scanner - I have tried to record it with all the angles and yet, I have had to try atleast 2 to 3 times before it recognises the fingerprint. So this too is a bit of an irritant.

Having said that, otherwise the device is awesome - the speed, the camera performance, the display, the OS, everything is a pleasure. I have now been using it for around a month now.

The price discount on Flipkart though is a huge put off and makes me wonder why I did purchase it from Amazon. One plus has to do something about it otherwise people like me will loose faith - especially for a company that's kind of just coming hitting the big time, they can certainly do without the controversy. And please, just urging people to buy from Amazon isn't going to help - Rs. 9000 discount is too big a discount to ignore other issues. So Amazon and One plus please do something and stop this sham that's on in Flipkart."
Oneplus3,4,06-Oct-16,"I am using it for a month.. Overall performance was good.. There is no lag in speed,high end games are running smoothly such as asphalt 8..
The camera bump is bit bulky definitely a back cover is needed to cover it. I am using spigen back cover which is covering the camera bump perfectly..
64gb memory is more than enough and i think memory card is not necessary..
One thing is that when using dual sim you cannot set custom ringtone for each sim card.. you can only set same ringtone for both sim.
Although the battery is 3000mah it lasts for a day of a normal usage...
Camera is really good, it takes great pictures and the front camera is really good
Fingerprint works very fast. The alert slider and gestures options are good.
Overall it is a best phone to buy... I really love this."
Oneplus3,3,01-Jan-17,Awesome phone to use and specification wise.. However screen breakage issues are common.. I dropped my phone from hardly any distance and screen was completely damaged.. I paid 8667 RS to fix the screen at a service center.. service was quick and flawless.. however I am overall disappointed with the screen quality and repair charges..Will not buy another one plus phone in future..
Oneplus3,5,30-Oct-16,"The phone is awesome in all aspects. Using for the past two days, everything is working fine. Only there is some screen display uniformity on a grey background like notification drop down menu. The left side of the screen is lighter than the right side. If anyone is facing same problem please share your views.The item was supposed to be packed inside a box package but shocked to see such a premium phone inside just a plastic bag with no protection at all. moreover the mobile phone box had several dents. AWFUL PACKAGING."
Oneplus3,5,24-Jul-16,"It is very speedy phone, use is very smooth. The look is stunning and best part is back which is none slippery. I like it to hold in my hand. Only thing I worry is non availability of screen guard, similar to what comes with OP3."
Oneplus3,4,02-Nov-16,"I stopped using android phones 2 years back & started using iPhone 6 Plus. Recently bought one plus 3 soft gold variant & after using it for 10 days I can say that except camera it challenges my iPhone in every aspect.

Dash charger is awesome. Keep it safe. I bought rosewood cover for my phone from official website because phone is really slippery.

Go for it guys."
Oneplus3,3,27-Jun-17,"dont buy accidentaldamage protection plan , its fake , after you send your cell for repairing under this plan they dont give you correct answrs , hold up your cell upto 15 -20 days then they will tell you expence is not undercover under insurance nd more then price of cell phone it self , my expense for repairing of one plus 3 is 39000 thousands hell yeah"
Oneplus3,1,19-Nov-17,"Bought this phone in july 2016. In less than 1.5 years now, this phone's motherboard is dead. It just stopped working in my hands. I have lost all th data that was on the phone and will have to pay 17K(almost 65% of the actual cost i bought it for that was 28K then) to get a new motherboard with no data recovery. Pathetic experience of the phone and the service. I think the flagship killer is just good enough to last for a year and a half."
Oneplus3,4,21-Oct-16,"Finally bought Soft gold variant and I want to say that it was a great decision to buy soft gold Oneplus 3....it looks great from front as well as from rear...Friends say it looks like iPhone 6 Plus...
Few cons..
battery drains fast but charging is fast really fast
Camera is good but not very good...

Amazon service was bad....I had cancel one order since it was never delivered"
Oneplus3,5,12-Jan-17,"Superb Phone for a very short description. This phone is a good buy than any samsung phones in terms of processor, battery backup and experience of a phone. You have hell lot of space to add apps, seasons, games , photos and even after adding everything you require and not require, its processor is just as fast as a brand new phone. I can almost compare it to iphone. But if you dont want an IOS phone definitely go for OnePlus 3. Better than its previous ranges than One plus one and One plus two. This product is definitely a bang on product in the market in terms of Camera specially. I have stopped carrying DSLR. I find it handy and easy to use for perfect DSLR type photos.
Perfect Picture, Anytime Anywhere"
Oneplus3,5,08-Aug-16,Awesome Phone for Awesome Price
Oneplus3,5,27-Jun-16,"I am using the phone from last 10 days and believe me it simply is a phone you want. Really gr8 UI, almost similar to stock Android ..no heating issues...played NFS & Asphalt 8 for long.. cool cam with this price range ... I really loved it."
Oneplus3,5,19-Aug-17,"Bought it this February for my sister, is still working good and the battery back up is really nice. Though within a month's time 3T arrived in the market. The picture quality isn't as enhanced as one plus 5 but is good in its own segment. The body is robust, even after falling from 2 feet height 3 times no scratches or broken screen. A bit bigger to fit into the jeans pocket completely."
Oneplus3,1,07-Sep-17,"The phone is not good. It keeps on hanging all the time. That too when I have no games, apps, music etc on my phone. It is used simply for calling and messaging. Yet it hangs. It lacks some features too. Besides, the phone had scratch marks when I received it. I wrote a complaint to amazon, but they never replied or attended the grievance. Having spent a large sun of money on this phone, in the end I am DISAPPOINTED."
Oneplus3,4,30-Sep-16,Fast delivery. Been using the phone for almost a month now. No issues yet. No lags. No bloatware. Camera is fantastic. Especially front cam photos look very fine. Overall Very satisfied with my op3. Better to buy this phone over overpriced brand phones
Oneplus3,5,14-Oct-16,"Excellent smartphone. Best bang for your buck. If you are on a budget of 30k, look no further. Excellent build quality, razor thin design, killer looks and top notch performance. The device has excellent xda support if you are into all that. Also one plus have their own beta program where you can test out pre-release versions of their oxygen os. The communuty builds are really worth a try.
Don't think, just go for it"
Oneplus3,5,09-Dec-16,"So far it seems to be a great product. Although there was a slight heating when I was installing all the apps on the first day, I haven't faced that since. Its pretty responsive and also gets charged in under 30 min.

And thanks to Amazon for getting the delivery done one day earlier than scheduled after I placed a request with customer care. I had originally scheduled the delivery for Sunday. But when I realized that I'll be home on Saturday and saw the tracking showed that it was already in Hyderabad, I called up and placed a request to deliver on Saturday itself if possible. And they thankfully did."
Oneplus3,1,05-Sep-16,"I have one plus 3, it's screen just peeled off slightly from one corner, that was reparable but OnePlus authorised Service person told me to replace whole screen at cost of Rs8000, later on I got it repaired from other service center at cost of just 400 Rs.Till now no issue in mobile for last 3 month.This just drawing attention to all customer who are going to buy or have bought OnePlus mobile"
Oneplus3,5,19-Nov-16,"OnePlus 3 is an amazing smartphone in this price range. Most of my friends are using it and given positive reviews about it. The mobile is lightweight and out performer. I check the stress management of this phone I tried to play 5 - 6 heavy games on it like GTA, Asphalt and all and still the phone is performing very well. Even dash charhing is one of the charming thing which made to buy this phone It really charges over 60% of the battery within half hour and battery life is amazing. If you are looking for best android smartphone under 30k budget go for OnePlus 3."
Oneplus3,4,30-Nov-16,"Ram management anol is good. But if you had just given the battery a bit more it would have sufficed. Great fone , attracts a lotta ppl . The spec is great but very sleek and delicate to hold . So put a sturdy cover for it. And if u got more money go for the op3T.

Camera I still feel moto is better than tis"
Oneplus3,4,19-Dec-16,"It's one of the best smart phones out there which is a has the fastest charger. It charges from 0-100 in 65-70 mins. And is quite good I think all other parts are well documented in variety of reviews.

It does tend to auto restart every once in a while and haven't been able to figure out why. It looks like an issue with 1+ so far as even my brother who has same device has the same problem"
Oneplus3,5,21-Oct-16,"I'm very much happy that i bought this mobile, its one of the powerful and well made mobile right now, thanks to its snapdragon processor and 6GB ram. Both the primary and secondary camera's are Amazing for thier high quality and sharp images. 3500+ mAh battery would have been very impressive but still the 3000 battery is good enough for a day. DASH charging made my life very convenient and fast, no need to worry about 2+ long hours of battery charge, 30 min charge will give 60% battery. Altogether OnePlus 3 is almost a Perfect phone with those specs and price range, Thanks OnePlus team!"
Oneplus3,2,25-Nov-16,"It is the greatest phone in its price range but there numerous bugs with the software and the oxygen os which the service center even could not resolve it. First and foremost is the screen overlay issue. Every time i install an app i have to visit the safe mode and provide permission for that app. This is the biggest bug and its causing me a huge trouble. 2nd is we cannot set different ringtones for different sim cards. 3rd is ram utilization is more than 50 %.
But the best thing is its charging facility, camera quality and speed. Though it is lagging from couple of days while playing games like death trigger 2 and asphalt 8. One Plus 3 kindly resolve the screen overlay issue for me its making a mess for me."
Oneplus3,1,02-Jan-18,"This product is good for few days. With the usage functionality of the product got degraded a lot. It never seems that it has 6GB RAM. My old phones (other popular brands) which is of 2GB RAM functioning a lot better. I have used other popular brands in the market(Both Android and iOS) but never faced issue like this. So even though I have this phone, I am still using my old phone. I just kept this phone aside. Complete waste of money. (After doing the Factory reset, it works fine for few days but again same issues.)

This may be the issue with the brand itself. Few other friends faced the same issue.

Please think twice before purchasing."
Oneplus3,1,30-May-17,"A very good phone! However there was a problem with the touch screen where touching a certain area was registered as two fingers. I have emailed and called customer support several times and have taken it to a service centre, however it was returned without any fix."
Oneplus3,5,23-Oct-17,"I need nothing to say about this phone. It is flagship killer. One year now using it, no flaws. Regular updates by company keeps my mobile as new. Not so perfectly design, i dont mind coz its damn strong and durable phone. Dropped it many many times, needed no repairs and got no starches. This made me to buy oneplus future model. Camera quality not so good on this one but they understood good camera phones helps promote sales."
Oneplus3,5,17-Oct-16,"Hello...I have purchased one plus 3 , it's really a superb phone with excellent camera and looks...it's finest touch with gorilla glass 4 and obviously the oxygen OS ..no word for it....if any body looking for a good phone with volte it's the best option....then Samsung S6 or S7 or any other expensive phone..with a cost of 28000...thanks One plus..."
Oneplus3,3,31-Jan-17,"its been six month i have been using oneplus 3 but 2-3 days before its automatically gets switch off while using and i tried so many times to power on it but nothing happen.and not a single time i have dropped the phone or was in contact with water.
if in six moth such expensive phone will comeup with this type of issue i would suggest you to not to buy it,
the battery also dies out much fast than what it actually should be ,thanks to its the fast charging that does not creates much problems."
Oneplus3,4,07-Oct-16,"The phone is almost on par with my expectations
Pros
1. Build quality
2.perfomance
3. The finger print sensor
4. List could go on and
CONS
1.I HATE THE PLACEMENT OF THE SPEAKERS YOUR HAND TENDS TO COVER THE WHOLE THING
2. Camera is good but a bit slow
3. Don't trust those 6 gigs of ram this phone has hanged a few times but I guess that's fine .
That's it
The phones doing great after a month so a thumbs up to one plus"
Oneplus3,5,19-Jun-17,"Being an amazon prime member won't hurt you so go ahead and be a member. Numerous benefits and you will get products at your doorstep in no time.

The product as usual is great and no complaints.

**1 yr Usage update**: Still works like a charm and no issues still."
Oneplus3,1,01-Feb-17,"This thing is heating like hell and battery drains so fast within an hour. Defective and amazon does not accepte return and asks us to visit centre even in the return window. Not buying mobiles again in amazon. Sorry being a loyal prime customer , i'm very dissappointed with your lame response."
Oneplus3,3,22-Nov-18,i bought this phone from all the good reviews but my touch screen in the bottom stopped working after one year and it lags at sometimes camera is just avg when compared to other 12-15 thousand mobile phones .....going to upgrade my phone but this time i m not going to buy a oneplus phone cause of the problems i faced by the oneplus 3
Oneplus3,4,16-Sep-16,"Awesome in all the specs such as camera,display,touch,finger sensor button and no lag in any app..Wow..
Why u should buy?
1. Super fast so multitasking without hiccups and u know why..go through specs..
2.Dash charger can charge one plus 3 in 30-45 mins so freedom from power banks..
3.Mobile feel awesome in my hand back finish so nice feels like I phone..
U can buy with no regret.

Can be work upon
1. Camera..too big camera at back which spoils the finish and look..see if you can add small camera.
2.call and voice quality to be perfect.
3.heats up.
Actually m thinking to find out improvements for this cell..all are perfect for a person like me."
Oneplus3,5,03-Dec-16,"This phone is a real killer.
1. Very responsive. No sluggishness.
2. Ultrafast charging
3. Good camera
4. Great spec

I bought this phone for my wife. I personally use S7 EDGE. Some of the features of this phone has really amazed me ,compared to S7 edge.
From fast charging to battery backup and camera features are really good. The spec is by far the best. Go for it!!!"
Oneplus3,3,16-Dec-16,The overall product is nice but the one thing that overpowers them all is the lacking in the battery department. The battery backup of the phone is nothing more than ordinary. The battery drains even on stand-by which is quite annoying. Barring that the phone excels in every department except the Touch Latency Issue.I am giving basically three stars mostly due to the battery backup issue
Oneplus3,2,25-Oct-16,"I purchased in august, it has a great features, after using it for a month there is minor problem with hardware, I have given for service center about 15 days back,
till today I have not received, having paid so much of many, I had to invest again
on standby mobile. So before buying this, buy one more handset as a standby."
Oneplus3,1,13-Jan-17,"Problem with this device arised with in 15 th day of delivery. Lock button got jammed and mobile automatically switched off and on every 10 sec. When i opted for return request, return window closed. Ne i hv no other option. And service center is 60km away from my city. I have to waste my whole day to get my mobile repaired.
U should not charge this much amount for which u cant provide quality mobiles."
Oneplus3,5,27-Sep-17,"Awesome device. I had gone through the negative reviews and found that the glass display was not that strong. But due to the over whelming positive respond, I went for it.
Feels premium and on the second day while showing off my device to my sis accidental dropped it maybe from a height of 3 feet face first and finally after sliding a short distance crashed on the wall.
My heart was in mouth and I was already having a nightmare of cracked display. But thankfully the device took the drop pretty well and due to the pre installed screen protector the damage to the screen was zero. Ya have a very minor bump on the side which is ignorable.
Final verdict the device is awesome and handles everything thrown at it with ease"
Oneplus3,4,06-Oct-16,"Top class Android phone right now in the world for this price...though some few minor cons we hope it could be solved in software updates...

Pros:
Fantastic display...
Ultra slim phone..
High performance you won't see any lag...
Fantastic rear camera with few features same like iPhone...
Good 4k video recorder...

Cons:
Average battery life..lasts for 16 hours only..but thanks to dash charger in 40-45 mins we can charge fully....
Average front camera...
Low sound..I have used k4 note before compared to that it is very very low...

Verdict:
best phone for this budget."
Oneplus3,3,26-Jun-17,"the product is good but I'm disappointed for not knowing about the physical damage service offered by servify.
I only got to know about it after the screen damage after few months of purchase.
Now I cant do anything even when the device is under warranty.
Another 1/3th of the purchase amount to spend or I will probably buy a new phone for same instead."
Oneplus3,5,26-Oct-16,"Fantastic Smartphone and Worth of every single penny. Stylish and Elegant. Very snappy in day to day usage. Thanks to the Sanpdragon 820 chipset, Adreno 530 GPU and 6 Gigs of RAM onboard made my day to day work very fast. Battery is Okay for a Day usage but sometimes needs two charges, but not to worry, Thanks to the Dash Charging of the OnePlus 3. Very Fast Charging in just 30 mins. Fantastic Product at the End of the Day. Far more better than most Flagships."
Oneplus3,5,21-Aug-17,Bought this a year ago and happy with op3. Have installed like 300 apps and downloaded tones of data on the phone and have kept the storage to like almost saturated Condition haven't found any problems yet and it works like a charm even when it's storage is full.
Oneplus3,4,26-Oct-16,"Used this new phone for almost a week.Good service. Phone is also great. Little issue of heating is there during charge. It was delivered on time. It's sad that earphone is not given in the package. It(earphone) costs extra 3K if you buy from one plus store.No visible speed of apps though it has 6gb RAM. It seems same as my previous 1GB RAM phone. Apps do hang sometimes.Complete RAM utilization not happening. Front cam though 8mp is not that good in medium light.These things stopped me from giving full 5 stars. There are lots of good qualities too like display, oxygen OS, rear camera photo quality.Much better than other phones."
Oneplus3,4,27-Jan-17,"1.Phone is Excellent, really a monster with no hangups.
2. Heats-up Rapidly, Bad.
3. Battery drains fast, Bad.
4. Not so compatible with Windows 10.
5. Charging/USB cable is short and not a universal charger.
6. You have to buy a very costly Car Charger.
7. No earphones!!! Company Should be Broad Hearted to provide a good earphone and a car charger."
Oneplus3,1,29-Aug-17,"This is the second time in these months my phone stopped working..Seriously Amazon you mean I just wasted around 60,000 rupees because I bought two sets of One plus 3 and one is not working anymore....no other option I am getting to deal with it.I will soon post the video whats happening with the phone."
Oneplus3,1,28-Jan-17,"Received a Defect Phone, and it’s been 3 months, not able to use. It is in service center since then and they are not able to resolve issue.
1. Head Phone is not working
2. Speaker Volume is very slow to hear
3. Service center Retired Without repairing it, I had to submit it again

I will Never Recommend to buy this. Please be ware"
Oneplus3,5,03-Jan-17,"This is my third Oneplus 3. All family members into oneplus. I just love OnePlus, built quality is amazing. And far better than so called ""Flagships"", (pssh: the battery doesnt burst either). Yes there are other phones in market with similar specs but either they are expensive or have far too many cons than pros. Dont think much and buy this beast. This is the best money move you can bet on with your eyes closed."
Oneplus3,5,24-Jun-17,"Hi friends..I am form Tamil Nadu I used one plus 3 mobile,this one is best mobile for every in my life , because I used Samsung (zoom) and grand and Samsung galaxy 5 and take Sony Ericsson (3) model phone I used and Sony Xperia 2 model phone I use, but last one year I used one plus 3 mobile phone no laking (last one word I used 24 hrs in online )no hanging prbm ......best mobile buy all.... friends ,my English is bad I know .sry for anything Wrong"
Oneplus3,5,09-Oct-16,Best phone I ever bought. Very fast and smooth. Only problem is with screen. It is too delicate and there are very high chances of getting damaged. I have already replaced it once. I used Samsung phone for 3 year's never faces the screen problem. May be quality of screen is not that good.
Oneplus3,4,21-Nov-16,"I came to this after using iOS and I found it to be a less secure by default. I have to enforce security policies on my phone and encrypt it with pin to secure it. Moreover camera wasn't up to the mark when compared to iPhone standards.

Other than that, the device simply flies. I have seen droid devices which hang a lot but this one is a pro! very snappy android without any lag and a very nice screes as well. I feel that color production in screen is bit unnatural, but that's tolerable.

"
Oneplus3,5,23-Dec-16,Dash charge is the best thing with this phone and apart from that camera and performance will take your soul. It's as good in performance area as it is in the looks.
Oneplus3,4,24-Nov-16,"Bought this beast a month ago...so putting up my review here now..

Plenty of positives like, sleek design, light in weight, v. good screen resolution, blazing fast performance, dual SIM, and decent camera and battery life. I installed Go launcher for 2 weeks but it took a toll on its battery life so removed it. Unfortunately there is no FM but one can still store plenty of audio/video files given its 64GB internal storage out of which approx. 90% is available to be used. The phone looks great without any back cover/case but one needs to be brave as well as careful enough for using it as such. Overall a Superb All-rounder phone at its price...Best in <30K category without a second thought.."
Oneplus3,2,19-Feb-19,"I actually liked the phone initially but the camera stopped working properly after about 1.5 years... camera does not focus. Not even in manual mode. With difficult, you tap on the screen few times and get the focus on where you want, but with in a couple of seconds, the auto focus kicks in and makes it out of focus. I am very disappointed for the money I paid... I had a oneplus one before this model, I am never going to buy oneplus phones again. Also i will not recommend this to others"
Oneplus3,5,15-Sep-16,"Its been a great experience so far .It feels awesome to hold this phone and people do look back at the phone and ask what phone is it. I am happy with the product performance, is ""awesome""!!! so far battery life okay so far dash charging really works fine camera is good sound is good with and without headset.....""""!!!! so go for it less price too much of quality in that price is a good deal. I hope it works just like it has been working since 15 days. Good product 1 plus team we want more :D"
Oneplus3,1,18-Jul-17,"I loved the phone before it got stolen within 8 months. It's sad to see that no matter how smart or best one might claim a phone to be, you can not recover it despite having all proximity sensors, full charge, good camera, gps, network connectivity.
I expected OnePlus 3 to be secure enough. But no, 28000 also can not buy you piece of mind"
Oneplus3,4,19-Sep-16,"the product is good, no issues so far.

The only concern is I get a feel of a very mild shock or a kind of vibration when I touch the sides of the phone while charging it and I have been told by many that its common and even i phone will behave the same way .I am afraid to contact to service centre, for such a simple issue, the service centre guy informs me that this is a touch screen issue. I wish one plus should train their associates properly and they are quite rude in responding to customers."
Oneplus3,4,22-Oct-16,Super product by one plus3 weighs light and got a good deal on the exchange of my one plus1 phone. The soft gold 64 GB is a beautiful one indeed apart from the technical features the phone has to offer. The phone is not a great music phone for listening. Dash charge is a good feature. Hoping the one plus care also offers good service. This is a good purchase at a reasonable price point and the best phone for 2016.
Oneplus3,5,04-Oct-16,"its one of the best phone in such affordable price, no one can beat. I am using from last 2 months. works very fast & smooth. everything is superb. Screen , camera, battery, finger scan, fast charging is plus feature. But there is no headphone by company. I will suggest to buy."
Oneplus3,3,09-Oct-16,"Received this device on last Wednesday..
Performance wise very good
Design is also looks solid,
But i am very disappointed because it feels warm and sometime little Hot even with small usage and normal browsing , i understand heasting is normal for heavy games or usage while charging.. but heating in normal usage was not expected ..
I bought it based on feedbacks from my friends as they did not noticed any heating issue. On normal usage but seems my device has some problems..so lets see if it gets resolved in coming updates

Also if you are unfortunate buyer of this device, as per new Amazon replacements policies
You need to go to OP service center and get a certificate for replacement.."
Oneplus3,5,09-Sep-16,What i've experienced in my last 15 days of use is that the performance is awesome and it doesn't get slow even after loading 50 apps in the background. The design is sexy .The battery is not bad as u might think. its ok. Dash charging is a treat ! The camera could have been a bit better. Thats it. conclusion- its the best value for money phone in the market right now
Oneplus3,4,30-Sep-16,"Great phone. Performance is brilliant and smooth. Great camera. I will talk about only the cons because everyone who want to buy the phone will know the specifications. :)
Cons: 1) Brightness should have been higher.
2) Battery drains fast. But the charger is awesome. It will get you to 95% within an hour. Do not expect to last for a whole day.
3)Loud speakers. But bass sound is not good.
4)Hard to find a good tempered glass protector for it. :P (till date there is none)
Despite having some cons I still love the phone. Most of the cons can be fixed with software update. Hopefully they will release it.
Thumbs up for the phone"
Oneplus3,3,19-Dec-17,Happy with the features but the screen is too vulnerable and was broken when the mobile charger fell on it. Went for replacement which costed me 10k. I had screen guard and still the screen didn't survive a slightest touch of a charger.Specs wise there is no competition in the price range to one plus
Oneplus3,5,24-Dec-16,one of the better phones available in this price bracket ... seamless functionality and wonderful speeds ... the pre-defined themes are slightly basic and can always download others ... very fast and battery lasts too ... quick to charge and sharp camera ... support to expand storage helps ... light weight and slim ... definitely recommended
Oneplus3,5,24-Oct-16,"An excellent phone with brilliant performance, vibrant screen color and good battery life. Camera quality is superb and the best part of it is the slow motion capture. Oxygen OS still need to match the customizations of CyanogenMod OS like True Caller integration, power button to capture photos and different sliders for volume adjustment. Overall the phone is pretty awesome :)"
Oneplus3,5,20-Feb-19,"Best smartphone that I have used so far. Picture quality is simply awesome, better than I-phone, I would say. I was using i-phone 6 earlier, then switched to this one. Battery life could be improved."
Oneplus3,1,15-Jul-17,I am not at all satisfied with the product. It's not even one year and it's already troubling. It's ear speaker is not working properly. I bought an expensive mobile and now don't understand what to do about it. I can't find it's service center and everytime I have take a call I have to put it on speaker mode. Everyone around me hear every single word the other person says it. The experience is pathetic....
Oneplus3,4,28-Sep-17,"The best phone in this range and segment....
The specifications are way above the other mobiles in same segment although still dissappointed with the screen resolution. Where you can see with samsung 4K display have become comon now, I wonder why Oneplus is left out in this comparison.
Rest its the best in class phone."
Oneplus3,4,24-Feb-17,"Great build and aesthetics.
Right dimensions for a good fit in the hands despite the large screen size.
Brilliant sound quality.
Camera - pretty good pixels it can capture, but the capture quality is not so good. Low right pictures - not good at all. Prone to blurred pictures maybe due to shutter speed.
Processor, memory and other config - love it. :)"
Oneplus3,5,29-Oct-16,"Amazing phone. Great features, sexy looks. Dash charge is awesome. Super fast processor with 6 GB ram. Camera is crisp and takes good pictures. Finger print sensor is super fast. The only con is it gets heated a bit which is very common for phones using Snapdragon 820.
Overall : Smartphone of the year!"
Oneplus3,1,19-Aug-17,"My bad, should have known it's a Chinese product. Anyways my phone( bought in June 2017 ) went dead while watching video and more than 50 % residual charge. It didn't come up for at least an hour, even when I plugged in to charge.
Guess what I did to bring it up. Tap hard on it's back. As I said Chinese PHONE!!!. never trust them! ( Hope you get the drift )"
Oneplus3,5,06-Jan-17,"best smartphone i have ever used first i read so many people review that their is this problem heating so many problems but i believe on that chinese smartphone and it make me so happy that i have never thought of everyone should use this smartphone you know the quality of Chinese smartphone compared to other flagship companies best smartphone rate 10 star if it jad it never think that it us is a Chinese model believe me excellent smartphone and it service is also awesome with the servify app make it easy
"
Oneplus3,5,03-Oct-16,"I've been using the OnePlus 3 for 3 months now and it's a great phone. Voice quality.. perf, speed...the dash charging is a great feature. Very happy."
Oneplus3,5,22-Feb-17,"I still remember how much I chased on the internet trying to figure out which phone I should buy. It's been about 6 months now and I'm still proud. This phones gives you a feeling of an ultimate achiever. Almost every phone in the past has disappointed me, but, not this one. The moment I opened the box and saw it, itbwas love at first sight. It's still there. No relation has ever been this good. Thanks 1+ ??????"
Oneplus3,5,13-Mar-17,"This phone is awesome, been using it for 6 months now and no complaints as of now. Would have gone for 3T version if that was available at that time. Works smooth all the time , camera is brilliant and dash charging saves a lot of time."
Oneplus3,1,28-Aug-17,"Got a faulty phone, screen touch is not working fine, the scroll sticks and automatically opens the item. Even the Colors on screen looks little faded l. I didn't expect this from Amazon. I would appreciate the they replace this faulty piece."
Oneplus3,4,03-Oct-16,"Well, after almost a months usage I understand why it's 27000 with the specs well the side viewing angles of the phone is amazing but when you test it vertically then u notice those changes in color like pinkish blueish color well that is because the AMOLED screen isn't of this highest quality and also the camera feels average but after you take the photos its amazing well no doubt about the performance in par and somewhere better than the phones out there with double the cost I would have given it a 5 star if it would have a better camera and screen."
Oneplus3,5,23-Aug-16,"If your budget is 30000, then go for this phone!
Phone is genuine and excellent.
But packing wasnt good enough and the sad part is this that there is no earphones with this phone.
Apart from this, phone is actually good"
Oneplus3,4,24-Nov-17,"If you are looking for a good camera ( front and rear) and a good battery life this phone s not for you... After using this phone for a year I can say that the front camera is horrible with poor image stabilization.. rear camera is fine.. low light images are bad.. also another BIG PROBLEM is BATTERY LIFE..I charge my phone 3-4 times a day after moderate use.. the battery is really disappointing ... Well, rest of the phone s ok.. good CPU and multi tasking is ok.. I will give a. Rating of 3 /5 for this phone...."
Oneplus3,5,15-Dec-16,"I used to have a Note2 which I could not part with, But after a lot of persuading by my wife and brother I bought this phone. And to be honest, it is a wonderful product and I havent touched my Note2 sinc"
Oneplus3,5,18-Dec-18,One of the best electronic goods I have purchased in my lifetime .A stock Android getting 4 generations of updates .Was definitely worth the money when I purchased it for 28k in 2016 oct . Nowadays op doesn't produce good phones in this price bracket . All mid range phones have inflated price nowadays with everyone setting the price similar to Apple phones .
Oneplus3,4,07-Oct-16,"Great phone. Great value for money. Good battery life and fast charging.
Some cons I encountered while using it...
Phone gets pretty hot on extensive or heavy use like gaming
Very slippery, get a case
Camera lens has got bulge which is not comfortable while holding, can use case to make it flush.

I took one star off as I didn't had Sim ejector tool in my sealed box of mobile. Don't have time to go and get a replacement for same."
Oneplus3,3,12-Feb-17,"The phone is excellent but the problem is related to service. Else I would give it 5 stars. Amazon did a quick delivery and I love the phone.

I have gifted one to my father. But when he had some problem with his charger the nearest service center for him was in a town far away... I was quite disappointed that I would have to arrange for travel and stay arrangements for him so that he can get the phone serviced... There was no other way Amazon or one plus helpline was ready to help. He had it in warranty and will get a free charger exchange but he would need to travel all the way to some other town.
This is usually not a problem when phone is working fine but when you've a problem, you've got yourself in a bad situation. And there are no guarantees that you wouldn't need service with a phone you bought."
Oneplus3,4,08-Nov-16,"Super Smooth and geat speed, built in quality is great. It's gives you stunning performance. Dash charge is very fast.

But the main drawback is #battery. Poor battery backup even for normal use you have to charge twice a day . it's irritating a lot.
Camera is decent and good in daylight. But overall just good Camera but not so great when compare to s7 or i7.
If you have no problem in charging twice a day, then don't miss this beast"
Oneplus3,5,22-Sep-16,I always thought that the Apples & the Samsungs of the world produce the best phones but OnePlus 3 beats many of the products hands down. People who are looking for new phones can check this option seriously.
Oneplus3,5,25-May-18,"After close to two years of using the phone, the phone still works just like new.
The processing speed, the battery and the app switching speed still amazes me.
Usually, a phone tends to deteriorate in it's performance as the years pass by. OnePlus has certainly done a great job!!"
Oneplus3,4,13-Oct-16,"Received the product a week after i ordered but nevertheless the phone is stupendous and incredible beautiful. It has Great looks and has a premium feel in the hands and is lightweight display is really good and battery back up is good along with dash charge superb, camera is really good i would say its on par with the iphone 6s and s7 edge beats them in terms of sharpness and clarity but overall a good camera great outdoor pics and good indoor shots. Sound is not too loud but average i would say. There is no place where i can pinpoint its weakness maybe the camera sensor could have been better if they had tried to but well the sensor that's provided is really good so not much complain there either but yes a battery of 3500mah would have been nice. Its lag free smooth and fast and at a price of 27999 it's a steal no compromise from oneplus this time. Overall a great device the best alongside the s7 edge and iphone 6s"
Oneplus3,5,22-Dec-16,The day I purchased it I was all lost because I didn't know how to lock it by fingerprint and many other things . But within a week I really liked the features of the phone and the best part is unlike other phone this takes hardly any time to get fully charged and battery back up is very good.
Oneplus3,5,26-Oct-16,"Thank you one plus for manufacturing one plus3, which is far better than any other android phones and faster than apple. One plus R&D has done a great job, we needed quick and easy access to unlock with high security n u gave us, fastest locking screen by double tapping, long press to go to previous app, extra features while screen off are also great features one plus introduced. Hope Indian manufacturers would compete with one plus or collaborate."
Oneplus3,1,10-Aug-17,"Bought OnePlus 3 just 2 months back, the device was getting hot, the battery completely drains in 3 hrs, It hangs in between, the WIFI was not getting connected. The reason given by 'Kompress' the manufacturer was that the software was not updated! They do not have any service centres unlike other phones! Amazon should ban such devices, instead of promoting during 'Big Sale'. NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
Oneplus3,4,05-Oct-16,"Some glitches. For example it doesn't allow me to give permissions to new apps. I have to go to safe mode to the modifications.
Another, it does not allow me to enter developers mode.
I also had some apps hanging, that was not the case with my Asus Zenfone 2, 4 GB RAM."
Oneplus3,5,24-Oct-16,"OnePlus 3 is the best phone Ever used. Love the phone. Superb Built Quality, strong, great specs, great camera, great os. Super fast touch id. accurate most of the time. Alert slider is great addition. Soft gold is a best to have. hate the camera bump. only 1 thing i didnt like is camera bump. Dash Charging is awesome no need to worry about battery.. Full day charge in 30mins."
Oneplus3,4,16-Oct-16,"Nice phone I peraonally like this phone b'cz we can do lot of customisation. All spects are great , works very well.. 5.5"" stil very slim & handy. Featurea are good. Slider bar. I like that function. Camera is nuce photos are crisp. Should improve on low li8 photos. And only one BIG disappointed is NO FM RADIO INBUILD APP. FLASH is oky kind. Last thing notification lii is there.. but should have more customisation colors. Rest all good. WORTH BUYING IT."
Oneplus3,5,18-Sep-16,"Don't think more just buy it, as mentioned it's flagship killer and it has all the features and performance is extra ordinary. Dash charge which I loves the most.
You won't get such a good phone in 28k. From last two years was using one plus one now upgraded to 3.
Request to OPO provide earphones too :)
It's worth to buy this trust me."
Oneplus3,5,14-Oct-16,"Delivery was very slow but the product is excellent. It is very sleek, elegant, and easy to use. Good product and one is considering to buy a smartphone, go for this."
Oneplus3,4,14-Sep-16,Awsome phone..I actually switched from my Nexus 5.. So for me battery life and memory was always a problem..otherwise nexus 5 is a great device.. So coming to one plus 3..its fast.. Stock android feel + some good features..64gb is more than enuf for me.. And dash charge is fast.. I give 4 because of downward facing speaker..but still its clearer and decent.. Luk and feel.. Is simply great.. Phone s not heating.. I am not a heavy user..camera..is good.. Esp.. I liked d manual mode..in natural light photos are really good..
Oneplus3,4,09-Oct-16,"ANYONE SEEKING TO BUY ONE PLUS 3 SHOULD WAIT FOR ONEPLUS 3T, THE LATEST UPCOMING MODEL WHICH WILL B AVAILABLE FROM 14TH DEC ON AMAZON. CHANGES IN ONE PLUS 3T ARE :-

1. 16 MP FRONT CAM ( OP 3 - 8 MP FRONT)
2. SNAPDRAGON 821 CHIPSET ( OP 3 820 PROCESSOR)
3. 3400 MAH BATTERY (OP 3 3000 MAH)
4. 30000 PRICE (OP 3 27999)

SO, WAIT FOR THE NEW MODEL ( OP 3T ) OR WAIT FOR RESONABLE PRICE DROP IN OP 3 (OLD)"
Oneplus3,4,17-Dec-16,Firstly thank you Amazon for the phone. Although it had been written next day guaranteed delivery but I got it in three days but that's fine. Three days are quite fast too. The phone is simply brilliant. I guess needs no reviews since its already received so much appreciation. Works quite good dash charging is superb in 1 hour it charges around 90. Camera loud speaker everything is perfect. And of course the 6gb ram and 820 snapdragon processor
Oneplus3,4,14-Feb-17,"You all know about the inside & it's very good. But outside, it has some problems (at least for me). I'm still not getting used to the grip as I was with the phones I've used earlier. It still feels like it will slip off my hand, maybe due to the curved edges. The power & volume buttons are prone to getting pressed while just holding the phone, which was not the case with any other phone I've used till date. I'm now using the phone with a cover because of these issues. With the cover I get a good grip & the buttons are safe, but makes it a lot bulky which beats the whole point of a sleek phone."
Oneplus3,5,08-Nov-16,"Its been a week since I've used the phone.
fast charging is awesome...60% in no time and 100% in a hour...battery lasts a day with normal use
screen is great, speaker is good giving good quality picture and sound while watching videos on device or even through casting or mirroring
so far no lag on video streaming or web browsing
apps open fast
camera is good not great as there doesn't seem to be too many modes and hope they can release a software tweak for this
slow motion video recording is a nice feature
few nice software tweaks that makes life pretty user friendly...like shortcut to torch via gesture and a quick memo app
been a great experience this first week hope and trust this will continue !!!"
Oneplus3,5,20-Dec-16,"I Can confidently say that one plus 3 is the best phone available in the market.The screen is awesome,battery backup excellent,fast, no hang ups...go for it guys... I'm using it for last 1month.. extremely satisfied with the product"
Oneplus3,5,21-Jul-16,"Phone looks absolutely awesome.
Performance is superb. Camera quality is very good. Doesn't heat up during gaming or charging. Dash charging is super fast.
Simply buy this phone. Really happy with it."
Oneplus3,4,22-Nov-16,"No lag after 15 days of heavy usage, not even once.
Pros::
I don't know what I have to write because I got a small beast as my phone in my pocket,i f i may write
1.Super Amoled screen
2.Rear camera
3.Dash charging(from 0to100 in 45 min)
4.Finishing
5.Graphite coating on back(i like graphite)
6.Speakers are of best quality
7.Accidental coverage for free for one year
8.6gb ram ,, so no lag at all
9.Pure stock android,, no bloatware at all.
Cons:
1.selfie camera is not a wide angle one..it takes time to get used to it
2.no front flash...
That's my review after using 15 days ..."
Oneplus3,4,04-Nov-16,"Can't give it five stars because everything looking so great, the phone unfortunately restarts many times. It's not much of a hindrance to me and I don't really return the phone and take the pain of transferring all data and settings; but this is quite unexpected from OnePlus. So one star less"
Oneplus3,4,03-Dec-16,"Good built quality can improve the UI experience the UI skin is not as good as Samsung galaxy phones.
There are few user unfriendly experience while using msg (SMS) and call options

Unread or unnoticed calls or msgs cannot visible on top the respective app

Camera quality is averave, can't compare with Samsung phones in similar ranve."
Oneplus3,5,25-Nov-16,"I just love it. Enough said. I know that the 3T is going to be more awesome but I may not have bought it as it is an extra few bucks to shell out. My oneplue one is still with me and working perfectly. Its faster, easier and I am waiting for the N update"
Oneplus3,5,30-Jun-16,"Indeed a nice phone, not to mention the pros. Just don't forget to switch on the HD mode before clicking for shots.
Phone was delivered before the estimated date. Happy with the shopping experience."
Oneplus3,1,24-Oct-17,Worst phone purchased via Amazon. I ordered the Fon two times. After day it stopped working properly after a few months. It has Corning gorilla glass 4 which is especialized for being saved from deadly drops. Unfortunately ... My one plus 3 got totally broken even via just a simple drop. I strongly ask amazon to get my fon either replaced or full refund.
Oneplus3,5,17-Oct-16,"I have never used one plus products before and I am totally happy and satisfied with my one plus 3. I waited long for the gold version of one plus 3 and it was all worth it. With all the features an ideal smartphone should Carry.... I must with a lot more. The touch is commendable with AMOLED HD display, camera is taking great pictures, fast charging, super sexy metal body, 6GB of RAM, with all these super featuresits a money value phone. The soft gold colour is very sober and classy..not too shiny. Can be called unisex color. The things which phone lacks is the micro sd card and battery life is little bit less but all these are negligible. Its definitely a flagship killer. It will challenge phones twice it's price and best phone in this price range. Must buy. Super elegant colour. I loved it."
Oneplus3,4,06-Jan-17,"Phone is decent. However, noticed a strange behavior while travelling to London that Map pointer was always offset by 10 degree. It is working fine in India. Read some article on google about compass calibration but that did not worked.
Back camera is very good during proper lights. During low light it captures grainy pictures but they are not too bad.
Front camera is ok.
Battery last for a day (with my usage)
Phone is fast and does not lag at all."
Oneplus3,1,24-Aug-18,"Motherboard failure exactly after one year. One plus service centre asked 18K to replace. I bought one plus2 earlier, that had huge battery issues.
In general I'm not recommending one plus products anymore."
Oneplus3,5,16-Nov-16,"After two weeks of usage, I got much impression on this beast. Awesome performance and awesome experience with this. This is my first Oneplus, I really appreciate the team.

I will update the full review after one month usage."
Oneplus3,5,26-Oct-16,A classy phone which lives up to its reputation. Really smooth UI and the cyanogen software does not allow any bloatware. The camera quality is decent and the snapdragon 820 chipset seamlessly addresses all the open apps without any lag. Pure unadulterated fun.Highly recommended.
Oneplus3,4,05-Jan-17,"It is really good mobile, looking good & light weighted. Stand-by time also very high comparatively with other mobile. it takes hardly 1 Hr for fully recharge..Appreciated

I definitely recommended this cell phone to any other."
Oneplus3,5,25-Sep-16,"This is a real flagship killer mobile....At price of Rs 27,000...u get a whopping 6 GB RAM & Inbuilt 64 GB memory plus loads of other features in terms of its camera, display, etc... Forget those expebsive I-phones which are ordered only for show-off...This product gives you almost all Apple I-phone at half their market price...Just Go for it...As regards cons for this mobile phone, nobody is perfect in this world even those expensive useless I-phones....Order for this flagship killer & save that extra money for some other adventures in your life"
Oneplus3,5,22-Feb-17,"This is a master piece, I'm a huge Mi fan but this amazing, if you compare the best of MI and one plus, then I'm sure it is very difficult to judge as to which is the winner, if u wanna buy the latest iPhone or latest Samsung and you can't afford those, go with this you'll never regret
"
Oneplus3,3,25-Sep-16,"Best .
But no cdma support .
No video cellular call support
Oxygen os no so customisation
Can't delete call history someone
Only quadcore processor
Lagging some time
Jio 4g network signal some time not working and need restart phone
No toggle for silent and vibrate mode
Not dual active mean only one sim 4g working and other Only 2g . And only calling by one sim.
Its ram ddr3 not ddr4 and not fell as 6gb

And many more

And battery backup low"
Oneplus3,4,11-Sep-16,"Not an expert but will share what I have experienced during past one month:
Positives: looks, performance, weight, overall feel, response, charging, fingerprint sensor
Normal : heating, battery, touch, camera, screen clarity, speaker,
Lacking : vibration when silent, scheduled power off and on function, IR, expandable memory
Not so good: grip, slider button, c type charging port, gestures"
Oneplus3,4,18-Oct-16,"Everything about the phone is perfect except for the MediaServer bug which was causing my phone battery to be drained at the rate of 1% every 3 minutes. The only fix I could find was to no use more than 25GB of space. In spite of that, I'd still give it a 4...it's that good. Oneplus, please fix this bug"
Oneplus3,5,31-Oct-16,"Best android till date, don't wait, do purchase and enjoy the quality product. Its really a treat to use this mobile. No cons.
Thanks to Amazon for there as usual packing and delivery"
Oneplus3,2,27-Jan-17,"Battery back up is pathetic, really guys if u r regularly online u need to charge your phone almost thrice a day, really bad experience, phone heats a lot and even after having a humongous 6 GB Ram it hangs, what to say guys after spending 28 k this really sucks. Highly disappointed."
Oneplus3,4,16-Oct-17,"Great Phone and enough has been said about its +/-. After a month's usage, I have noticed a problem with the ringtone. Most of the time, the volume gets reset to zero and end up missing calls. Also, it runs hot while watching videos... otherwise a smooth and super fast phone"
Oneplus3,4,02-Nov-16,"phone to bahut badiya hai pr amazone ki service 10 din warrenty ke bad bahut hi bura

Oneplus3,4,29-Oct-16,"Though I am yet to experience the full potential of this amazing device, the only thing I am put off with is the screen protector that came preinstalled with it. The screen protector is short of half a cm from both the sides of the phone. That shortness really interacts with the display and the viewing experience is bogged down."
Oneplus3,5,31-Oct-16,"Great camera, great dash charging, descent battery, awesome display, great aluminum body, great 2.5d covered display, gives a little bit feeling of edge display, best and i think the fastest finger print scanner.... everything is great about this phone. You cannot get anything better than this at this price. Only problem i am facing is that i am not able to get good accessories for the phone like back cover and tempered glass, all the tempered glasses available are too small fir the screen due to the 2.5d glass on the phone. But i found an awesome shatter proof flexibke glass which i feel is better than any tempered glass and also fits perfectly and covers the whole screen ."
Oneplus3,5,03-Feb-17,"AMAZING PHONE!! Loving the experience. Dash charging (5/5) is a great thing to have especially for a careless person like me who often forgets to charge her phone or puts her phone on charging and forgets to turn on the power ;)
User interaction is also smooth. Really fast. Voice quality is 5/5. Camera is also 4/5"
Oneplus3,5,29-Oct-18,There is not much to write about this phone as it is the most epic smartphone company and smartphone. The resale value is above the charts. I will prefer OnePlus device over any other.
Oneplus3,1,04-Oct-17,"I am facing a lot of problem in the hand set. The voice quality is not at all satisfactory in both the cases hearing as well as microphone side too. Finally took a decision to move back to Samsung and not to buy new products with no established Brand. Would also suggest Amazon not to play with your Brand Reputation and promote such unreliable products. You can very well see from my account that i had purchased two mobiles, but now regretting for the same since last 6 months."
Oneplus3,2,31-Aug-17,"Writing this review after 8 months of usage. A well designed phone with very good UI and performance, and the worst ever battery life; lasts nothing more than 6 hrs per charge. Dash charge is a big sham; charges fast, drains super fast."
Oneplus3,4,28-Dec-16,Very nice & awesome flagship killer. The only con till now is not that much pleased with the rear camera. I expect it to be better. But let's see if tweaking the camera settings will help or not. Apart from this it is a sheer masterpiece till now.
Oneplus3,4,31-Oct-16,"Awesome.. Very good smartphone at an affordable price.. However, heating problems are there, especially during charging..
Gaming performance is just great.. I have played Leo's fortune, Marvel future fight, temple run 2.. All are just perfect without any lags or framedrops..
Camera is also good..
Oxygen UI is just awesome and I'm highly impressed with it..
Hardware quality is genuine..
A flagship of 2016..
Among the top 10 smartphones to buy in 2016.."
Oneplus3,4,28-Sep-16,"The delivery was on time . The piece looks really nice in hand . It is the best phone in this range . There is NO OTG and set of headphones in the box so do not expect . A screen guard is by default installed on the device . But still you will need a tampered glass or something .
When u order the phone just order a back panel or cover together . Because the phone is a little slippery .
Rest , its all great . Thanks AMAZON"
Oneplus3,5,31-Oct-16,"Excellent phone from one plus ...as a big fan of one plus I own one plus 1 and 2 already but this one is standout compared to 1 &2 .Looks, specs every thing is good.main plus point is charging speed after terrible experience from one plus 2 (2.4hrs+ charging time) one plus 3 takes only 1hr from 0 to 100 thanks to dash charging.25 to 30k range it is the best phone go for it."
Oneplus3,5,26-Aug-16,I really love this phone after using a week has a great battery after using samsung and Le phone i think one plus is far better i am just not satisfied by one plus not providing ear phones with a 28k phone overall i would rate it 4.8/5
Oneplus3,4,29-Sep-16,I love the phone and works like a charm and is the best in class. My issue is I have not yet received Rs 2000 cashback despite receiving the notification mail from Amazon. I had ordered the almost 3 months back on July 8 during the Cashback sale from Amazon on Standard Charetered Credit Card. Please credit the cashback at the earliest so that the phone is not marred by the poor Customer Service for cashback
Oneplus3,4,17-Oct-18,"One plus regularly beats competition because it provides the best features at the lowest price. No issues except some software updates, resolved quickly."
Oneplus3,5,26-Sep-18,"Even after almost 3 years , this is a no problem phone. So Happy with the purchase that now we're one plus family from Apple family. Will purchase 3rd phone of same brand next month??."
Oneplus3,4,24-Sep-16,"Over a month has passed using this mobile.
A great mobile with great features
Only one issue faced till now, sometimes back key(which is left to home key) doesn't response.
Or else mobile works properly, without any lag.
And they are not providing earphone, hard luck.

Oneplus3,4,26-Jan-17,"One of the best phones and all know good things about the phone which I will not repeat.

Cons:
1 i am afraid that it will get scratches so using cover for it and i do not like to do it.

2 latest update have some issues.

3 adaptive brightness some times act funny

4 battery life is ok. Expected more performance."
Oneplus3,3,20-Oct-16,"Good Phone with some software issues.

1. New incoming msg of whatsapp and normal msg will not display on its ikon. (Annoying)
2. You can not delete a single call.
e.g If you get call from same number 5 times at a time then u have to delet all call together.
3 Side slider can not make phone on vibrater while in silent for that u have make ring volume zero. (Pathetic)
Also there is no option on toggle."
Oneplus3,5,17-Nov-16,"Are you serious?
You don't need to read any review of this product. Its the best phone you could get for this price. You can compare it to any phone and the Oneplus 3 wins because of its price. Any other phones which offer this Specs and this quality, the have a high price tag.
Comes with Snapdragon 820, 6GB RAM, 64GB internal memory, 16MP Primary + 8MP secondary camera which takes great quality pictures. What more do you want?"
Oneplus3,5,27-Feb-17,For the price this is the best flagship phone in the market. You can see the specs of the phone and the price so its up to you but I recommend this phone for a flagship under 30k.
Oneplus3,5,19-Nov-16,The best phone available in ' Under 30K ' range.. the device is a beast.. especially for moderate users like me.. runs smooth like crazy.. although it's just been 2 days.. I can already feel the superiority of performance.. best buy ever
