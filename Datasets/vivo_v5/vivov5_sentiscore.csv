"84","vivo v5+",4,"15-Nov-17","I have been using Vivo V5+ for 2 months now.
1. Battery backup is good.
2. No heating issues.
3. From 0 to 100% charge in 45mins with turbo charger.
4. Quality of photos are great with both front and rear cameras.
5. With 4GB RAM, you can download an 1GB movie in 5 mins with 40mbps speed.
6. You will really like the Sleek design once you hold the phone in your hand.
You can go ahead for this phone if your budget is between 15 to 20k however vivo v5+ is overpriced. You can blindly buy if you get offer below 15k.
All the Best...","Nov","2017",4

"165","vivo v5+",5,"21-Jun-17","Well i am using it about 3 months.
What i like about the phone is
Selfie camera is best i have never seen my self so much better in pic.
I am a music lover . Hi fi music mode given is absolutely terrific permonance.
It takes around 90 min to charge completely.
Battrey is good . Once you full charged it will run for whole day.
Screen and touch is good and smooth.
But the phone is big in size and also it is heavy if you drop it by mistake then it will break.
Look wise without back cover you will love it .it is sexy beast.
Head phone given with phone is too good.
4gb ram.64 internal is sufficient.
It gets heat some time during charging.not too much or like heater
Other than that it does not heat.","Jun","2017",5

"188","vivo v5+",5,"15-Oct-17","nothing like","Oct","2017",4
"189","vivo v5+",1,"04-Oct-17","After 2 weeks usage:

Camera : Decent selfies not gr8 as advertised. Rear camera not so good images blur when zoomed.

Performance : This is where this phone lags and even with 4 gb ram and snapdragon processor this phone is extremely slow it cant handle even 3 apps. Doing multitasking is hazard on this phone if you are listerning music and browsing internet or just opened another app there is so much lag!! Zero for speed performance to this phone. Even 2 gb ram and lower processor phones are way fast and multitask good but this phone is pathetic i dont expect such lags in this configuration. So straightaway reject this phone!!

Battery: So far good lasts daya with avg usage.

So my opinion Do Not Buy this at all! we could not bear a phone with this specs to cannit handle few apps simultaneously.","Oct","2017",2
