oneplus6T,2,04-Nov-18,"Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.

I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems."
oneplus6T,1,04-Nov-18,"1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.
2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.
3. Camera quality is very poor.
4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.
5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.
6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.

I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product."
