oneplus6T,2,04-Nov-18,"Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.

I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems."
oneplus6T,1,04-Nov-18,"1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.
2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.
3. Camera quality is very poor.
4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.
5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.
6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.

I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product."
oneplus6T,5,04-Nov-18,Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone
,1,13-Nov-18,"OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?

My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.

It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.

I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon."
,5,06-Nov-18,"Got delivered in just 2.5 hours of my order. No bad overservations yet. Fingerprint unlock is also good, if you have face unlock ON then all the time it will unlock with face data before the the fingerprint works."
,1,07-Nov-18,"Two days back I received 6T and had many problems with the mobile
The mobile is getting heated when it's on camera mode or doing nothing., and while using mobile it's getting struck.. I don't think I got an original set, I'm sure it's a duplicate set.
Please for god sake please exchange my mobile with a new one"
,5,04-Nov-18,"Amazing phone, just feels good.
Done the ma+h, price isn't everything.
You get what you pay for. :)

Excellent battery,
Great screen,
Amazing performance,
Smoooth OS,
Great camera,
Surprisingly decent audio,
Cool screen unlock and ridiculously fast face unlock."
,4,08-Nov-18,"Good build.

good accessories on op site.
cool phone box packing.
in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.
loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.
value for money. Go for it!"
,5,04-Nov-18,"The OnePlus 6T is a truly great phone no matter what the price, but at half the cost of an iPhone XS with a cutting-edge in display fingerprint sensor this is the bargain buy of the year. Everybody is complaing about in-display fingerprint scanner is slow but trust me its very very very fast, phone gets unlocked as soon as your finger touches the screen and more accurate than other phones, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that cutting-edge technology doesn’t have to cost the Earth, bringing an in-display fingerprint scanner and a tiny notch for just 37K. The gorgeous, crisp and colourful OLED display is a smidgen bigger at 6.41in, with a smaller chin at the bottom is simply amazing, coming to camera the new nightscape low light mode does a good job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is also pretty good Portrait mode works as advertised, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is good and when you use the fingerprint sensor the night mode for the display is disabled temporarily and then fades back in once you’ve unlocked the phone. The phone comes with a screen protector already on it. the single bottom-firing speaker is loud and has a relatively large amount of bass for the phone, but is easily blocked while playing a game. OnePlus’s alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and is still brilliant. OnePlus phones have always been good for the money, offering top specifications in well-built devices, but not pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. That’s changed for the OnePlus 6T. It is pushing what’s possible with the popular all-screen design using a tiny, attractive teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and it’s a better phone for it. But it is the introduction of a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, and making it work really well for as little as half the price of an iPhone XS, that is most impressive. there’s no wireless charging, it doesn’t have any of the fancy 3D face systems of some and it looks a little plain, but everything else is top notch. Even the software experience is excellent.
Pros:- Good battery life, great screen, excellent performance, dual-sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5, great software, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, affordable price relative to premium phones, last but not least Blazing fast software
Cons:- No notification light, glass back but no wireless charging, no expandable storage."
,5,05-Nov-18,Issue with the Camera Slow Motion Mode is Not Working in Home Black Shade is Moving from left to right Sound Quality is not that good
,5,15-Jan-19,"This has by far been the best phone I have ever used hands-on. Flagship Specs, Classy look, Premium Packaging and the Speed you Need!
Appearance - The device looks very much similar to the OnePlus 6T upfront but it has got the speed orange highlights at the back, carbon finish and McLaren Branding at the bottom.
Camera - The night mode really captures amazing pictures and the portrait mode is just amazing. The low light photography could still be improved.
Battery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.
Speed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag. And its bragging rights for sure!

Overall, I am really satisfied with this device and feels great to be a part of OnePlus Community! Go, get it! Its for those, who are in continuous pursuit for speed!"
,5,04-Nov-18,"Very nice and fantastic phn, the best smart phn till date, awesome camera good battery life"
,1,04-Nov-18,"They are telling it comes. With strongest back glass, on the first day itself, for a drop from 4 feet hieght my phone got a new back shattered glass"
,4,05-Nov-18,I like its full display and picture quality is good but temperd glass should be given to all customers
,5,05-Nov-18,"Crisp picture quality, impactful sound and an impressive battery life makes it a worthy investment. A blind buy for those who plan to upgrade to OnePlus from others...
Fingerprint sensor, face unlock are exciting features but not indispensible.
All in all its a fair deal if the base variant itself is 128gb!! What more can u ask for!!
I'm happy...
N yes...Thank you Amazon for the On time delivery.."
,1,12-Nov-18,"Bought the costliest one. 8gb 256gb model.
Received a phone with flickering screen, screen shows different colors every now and then... Battery drains fast and phone heats up even on normal usage. I have used OP3t for 2 years and never faced any problem. But This one didnt stay even for 2 days and I had to request for replacement. 1 day passed and no help, finally anazon says replacement not possible, only refund possible. I hope at least the refund process goes smooth."
,4,14-Jan-18,"Used it for close to 45 days now, overall a very good phone but for this price point i would expect much better camera. Since Asus Zenfone 5Z also gives similar performance at almost less than 10K. Camera in night mode needs more improvement and does not capture the picture properly .. may be i need to do some tweeks in settings i am not sure. Please see the image i uploaded the fire is tarnished with grey .. same picture without night mode is much better. This is my first 1+ phone .. satisfied but because of camera giving 4 stars."
,5,04-Nov-18,"Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered."
,4,11-Jan-19,"Picture quality is good. Battery life is decent. Sound quality is okay. It's not a beast in any regards considering it's price and the flagship killer tag. You may miss the notification led and the 3.5 mm audio jack. The in screen fingerprint reader is a cool feature but surely feels that first gen not so smooth feature. It just gives you the feeling of not buying a finished product but a work in progress kind of a thing. Not many things to complaint about since it does give you good specifications for a decent price but.. it's no longer a flagship killer to stay. One plus may very well be the new apple. I'd hate to see that happen, but they're in the business for profit afterall. It can't always all be about the community. But I see them get run over by budget phones if their competition could maintain quality"
,4,04-Dec-18,"I received the order @ time thanks to Amazon for delivered @ right time now coming about the phone experience as of all you know why ppl like oneplus is all because of their user interface Yea the oxygen OS it feels buttery smooth with no lag and 0 bloatware it's clean and faster than stock android.,performance is awesome no doubt on that., but display isn't upto the mark like I won't be comparing it to the Samsung displays but to their own previous generation phone., I own a oneplus 3t already been using it fa last 2 years that phone display feels more premium and vibrant than one on the oneplus 6t like 10% brightness on the oneplus 3t is equal to 40% brightness on oneplus 6t but still this display is good and another con is the headphone jack they keep trolling iPhone fa removing the headphone jack last year and used headphone jack as key marketing fa selling their phones @ US and other countries but now no headphone jack that's really ridiculous., it's okay to use the USB c to headphone connector to use while @ home but not comfortable while you do gaming or when you have your phone @ pocket during traveling like you gotta spend some 2k to 4k fa wireless., build quality is good of course it feels premium., especially the one I have Thunder purple it feels more premium., battery life is awesome it lasted about 14 hours with on screen time about 9 hours ( been playing pubg about an hour, YouTube,chatting and browsing, 4g has been on almost all these time) and yea you ll miss that led notification light and they did some compromise with built quality like the earpiece grill and sim tray looks and feels cheap material more like plastic., no stereo speakers but two sound grills and yea it kills all other phones @ performance that includes Samsung note 9 @ this price ( half the price) if you into performance go fa this phone., thermal heat management is good."
,3,11-Nov-18,Everything is good about the phone except some software bugs like gestures dnt work flawlessly and i have issue with paint coming out from the top part of the phone near the ear piece
,4,04-Nov-18,Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor. It is very sensible I must say unlike the back one. I need to put my finger in proper way otherwise I won't be able to unlock my phone.
,1,05-Nov-18,"The phone got stuck while using one of camera features. Its not even getting restarted. The screen is freezed thus, not allowing to proceed further. Hope i get a replacement soon."
,2,05-Nov-18,"1.Takes too long to charge...took 80minutes to charge from 10%-96%.
2.Battery life went down from 100%to 10% in less than 20hours without much usage.
3.Fingerprint sensor not very receptive."
,1,14-Nov-18,"1. Picture quality zero third class
2. Heat while charging
3 heat issue while playing game like pubg
4. Slipry grip
5. Heavy weight
6. Camera in night also wrost
7. When you zoom picture taken by 6t shows the blur images and red eyes
8. There lack of A. I artificial intelligence
9. Face lock security is totaly unsafe i tried open with my passport size foto & opend screen lock
10. Battery life is good fast charging but heating issue also
11. No headfone jack you have to manage with charging jack adapter of headfone

I return after using 2 days & thanks to amazone to refund on time and saves my money by return / refund policy"
,4,04-Nov-18,"If you are a op5,op5t or op6 user it is not worth upgrading
cons of oneplus 6t:
1 the indisplay fingerprint is way too slow and does not work always
2 the phone still has some network connectivity issues(s/w upgrades may fix them)
3 phone works fast BUT expensive for the price and lacks good features like IR blaster,gloves mode, only limited gestures
4 it seems interesting for a week, later its just a normal budget phone
5 the low light photos in 'nightscape' is still bad,overall camera is just OK(not as hyped )
Pros:
1 Phone feels more premium than Rs.25,000 phones but still does not provide the vibe of apple or samsung(note & S series)
2 has good customer care support (especially online)
3 the software(oxygen OS) is really smooth,no lags at all

for those looking for phones for at least 2-3 years of usage,if possible wait for oneplus 7
hope to see a triple rear camera and 5G on oneplus7"
,3,04-Nov-18,"First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....

I don't know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.

Read till the last for my last suggestion

1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I'm sure this is the best Offer one can get and I'm sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.

2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.

3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.

4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool

5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months

6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.

7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage

8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area

9) The charging rate is good, I'm sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage

10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I've used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don't like this.

11) I've used the phone with google maps ""ON"" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.

12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That's up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.

13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I'm not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...

14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here

15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...

I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.

As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage condition

Trust Me friends, don't waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera"
,5,04-Nov-18,"Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.

Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).

Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.

Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.

I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.

Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone."
,1,04-Nov-18,"very poor product from one plus and neither amazon is replacing the device battery didn't last long much not even 5 or 6 hours the device is malfunctioning like opening apps on it's own and volume is increasing or decreasing on it's own
not satisfied with the product"
,2,04-Nov-18,"Phone functions are nice. Battery performance is not lasting good. Battery is dying very rapidly. I am changing full charge twice in 24hrs still battery is getting down to 19%. Most funny part is that I am hardly using my phone. This is very depressing after paying such a big amount (hard earned money) of Rs. 38000/- and battery performance is so much poor.
Spoken to the Amazon technical support for this. They have done some online test through some app and get to know that something is wrong with this phone battery and told me for the ""BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE"" on Monday 5th November 2018. I have received my phone on 2nd Nov and spoken to Amazon technical support engineer on 3rd Nov. Although I haven't received any email / SMS from Amazon yet. I can trust them on there words and will receive brand NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE on 5th November itself."
,5,05-Nov-18,"Pros: Glamorous looks, great free case, free screen guard, camera like SLR, super fast, face detection is lightening fast.
Cons: On screen sensor not super quick if not properly setup. If you setup properly, it's good."
,3,04-Nov-18,"Hello Guys,
I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.
1- battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.
2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.
3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.
4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed in 20k phone easily.
5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.
Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and
2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.
If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.
I am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good. Now choices upto you."
,2,15-Nov-18,"Things are not the same as promoted, I bought this on 2nd Nov, look wise its good, sound is also loud, its just loud nothin else, battery has just improved marginally if you keep your location on and play some game or video, it will be low very soon. Ofcourse at the end it will hang little longer but not as expected. Display Hangs!! Yes!!! this phone hangs even with 8gb RAM, have faced it few times even in first 10 days. Worst part is the front screen lock is too too slow, even i have to use pin code most of the time. Overall the phone launch was just a hype but the performance is not upto the expectation!!!"
,5,04-Nov-18,"Battery life is better. Picture quality is good. Sound quality is also reasonably good but definitely not the best among its competitors. Having said that, this phone is really really fast. Display is awesome. Dash charger is wow as usual."
,3,08-Nov-18,"Purchased with great excitement but disappointed the day i got this phone.. Being a flagship killer, i never expected this phone to face heat issues even with a normal usage..the same problem didn't arise with my brother's phone which he took on the same day... Apps didn't download but some how solved that issue later.. And now some apps are force closing and not working.. Remaining features live upto the mark. But being a oneplus fan, my expectations were sky-high about the 6t..slightly disappointed but not a big deal.. Can adjust with thi"
,3,04-Nov-18,"No headphone jack! Just bigger battery and water drop notch. No camera improvement, below expectations.... Don't buy this phone just wait for oneplus7 ( hope some exiting features)... If you have oneplus 6 then don't buy it because no major ( even minor) improvement in it ( 6 is better than 6t) and if you are not a oneplus user then also don't buy it. I was so excited about this phone but disappointed."
,5,12-Nov-18,"For the cost , this is one value for money product. It is feature rich and perfect for a person like me. Am an avid foodie and traveller. This is a perfect phone to capture what I want whenever I want . And with amazing clarity. Also amazing speed . I became a fan with OnePlus 3 and this one has be convinced that this is one of the best smart phone options out there."
,5,09-Nov-18,"The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.
Cons :
Concern is the notification led light. we are not sure whether battery is 100% while charging. Single touch display to see notification is beautiful.
One plus should have added the charge + 3.5 jack in type c converter. which would be added value for those who watch movie or listen song while charging."
,1,05-Nov-18,"Battery is terribly bad.
On round edges I lose the display as it cuts the actual view.
Sometimes AutoRotate does not work. I have to restart the mobile."
,1,14-Nov-18," have purchased this phone and trusted amazon for over 2 years but now i am feeling stunned with the product quality.This phone gets switch off sometimes and getting ON only by hard rebooting but when i tried to return it , first a 3rd party app told me that your phone is all right. So if this kind of service is provided by amazon then i am not gonna do any kind of purchase from amazon.This is very bad.Worst service by amazon"
,4,04-Nov-18,Phone is awesome camera check display check battery check... There is minor glitch with play store it is pathetic to download a new app as they always shows downloading or download pending.... Hope OnePlus will fix this…
,5,04-Nov-18,"Good phone but not best.... but delivery was superfast, order in morning 9 am and delivery in evening 7pm"
,3,11-Nov-18,"Picture quality is not up to the mark, it's not as per the description given. Need to work hard on the same. Pic gets blurred when we zoom the camera. It states 20mp camera, but I don't think so that actually is."
,5,09-Nov-18,"Best Android phone till date. I have been using it for 3 days now and OnePlus didn't let me down.
* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.
* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).
* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.
* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.

This is the best phone you can buy in 2018 and early 2019 at around 35-40k. So go ahead and buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it!"
,2,27-Dec-18,"1. If you will see IPHONE then each application's UI will be the semetrical and properly handled, Unlike the oneplus 6T
if you will notice then while you are in CHAT then Bottom SEND and left SMILY button will not show 100% properly.
2. Without using any app it consumes 4+GB of RAM.
3. Camera quality is OK+ , Because its using almost same library of PIXEL phone, But not match that image processing quality. FRONT CAMERA QUALITY is just WROST ever if you will try on Artificial Light condition.
4. If you ZOOM once you took the picture it will not show the Best quality resolution.
4. If your phone will be in IDEAL mode for 10+ mins then your phone will be freeze for 7-8 Seconds."
,5,07-Nov-18,"AS I HAD ALREADY CUSTOMER OF ONE PLUS 5,IAM VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WITH PACKING MATERIAL OF ONE PLUS 6T, I COMPARE BOTH BOXES OF ONE PLUS 5 AND 6T
WHEN I PICK MY NEW PHONE 6T,I FOUND MATERIAL USED IS VERY DULL,MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS 0
BUT OVERALL PHONE IS WORKING WELL WITH LESS BATTERY BACKUP"
,3,11-Dec-18,"The phone is excellent software and internals wise. However the cons are as follows:

- all glass. Serves no purpose and makes the phone fragile
- no notification light
- no headphone jack. Pointless omission simply to ape Apple
- ambient display brightens up too much for sensing fingerprint and is very irritating at night
- phone is a tad too big. They should ideally have kept the 5.5 screen size from the op5 days and removed the bezels instead of increasing the size of the phone
- terrible vibration motor. My old nokias from the last decade had much better vibration. Not expected from such a premium phone"
,3,05-Nov-18,"Very desappointing on sound quality on both Bluetooth and earphone, I have LG BOM box and Bose sound link Bluetooth speaker, sound quality very poor in Bluetooth connectivity, it's also not support 2 Bluetooth speaker play simontiously like Samsung 8 , LG phone, honer play phone, tried LG , mi and Sony earphone with phone sounds came very poor, only phone speaker quality is good.
Reast display also not up to satisfaction level as compared with LG q7 thinq and Samsung galaxy series 8 and 9, Battery draining fast, no benefit on night scape feature in this phone, still front camera needs to improve, touch and phone speed is very good as like erlier OnePlus phone, but not getting anything new in this phone, appat from notch display, even touch finger sence some time not working, and not speed as like back finger sence earlier. Not recommended for music lover."
,5,04-Nov-18,"I'm in love with everything that this phone provided but I'm not able to digest the missing of headphone jack
The performance is spectacular. The fastest phone on Android side of things at least.
Camera is damn good and that night mode though ??
Battery life is also extraordinary. I'm getting about 8 hours sit and with gaming like pubg 6-7 hours
Screen! Man this looks gorgeous
Built quality is also perfect what you expect from oneplus
Ui is one of the best I've used
Totally one of the best phone you can buy at around 35-40k"
,2,13-Nov-18,"Camera is pathetic. Takes blurry pics sometimes. Pics gets detoriarated on little bit of zooming also. Looks like its a 8mp camera. Samsung takes better pics even in 8k phone. Low light is equally bad. Poor selfie camera. Those saying awesome camera have no idea about cameras. Improve camera performance in the next update.

Its blazzing fast. Smooth. Looks great. But cam and speakers r disappointment."
,4,22-Nov-18,"This was for my sister. She previously had iphone 8 and believe me she loved the oneplus.
I am myself using a oneplus 6 and while comparing it with the T version.

There are only slight differences apartment from the notch size battery capacity and on screen fingerprint reader.

I particularly doesn't feel for the need for a quad HD screen since the screen quality is amazing.

They could have added bwtter camera modules and instead of the depth sensor , they could have put a telescopic lens

Speaker quality has improved from the 6 but they should have added stereo speakers.

I know some are xomolaing about the jack but sooner or later everyone will start using Bluetooth headphones, just like touch screen phone made a revolution.

The biggest upgrade that i personally feel is the 400mah increase in battery capacity.

I never had any issues with the 6 but the 6t wouod easily last 2 days for a moderate user"
,5,06-Nov-18,"They are exactly Working on their tag line ""the speed you need"". It's very fast. Very very fast. Talking about camera, that would have been better than op6. But nothing changed. Night scape is very good change. You can feel the light in nightscape mode. Audio is better than most of smartphones but not up to One plus mark. Battery life is best. You can rely on his battery for only one charge of half an hour with full day battery life even if you use it fully. Fingerprint scanner can't be better. New update help him open fast. If you have budget of 35k, buy it without second thought."
,3,26-Dec-18,"The phone overall is supposed to be flagship killer. But the truth is that despite killing flagship it can’t kill the performance and stability of the previous model one plus 6. As someone who has both the phones in the family my observation is in comparison with one plus 6 and I feel one plus has gone down on the standards with the new phone.
Pros
Better sound than 6
Photos have better depth and clarity
Battery back up is good
Cons
Fingerprint unlock is absolutely lacking performance and does not work at times
Phone hangs at times and does not feel like it’s a one plus product or having 6 gb ram
Camera freezes and sometime renders all buttons including power button action less

Hope OnePlus comes with a sw update to handle all the issues, else this is gonna bring bad press for them."
,3,04-Nov-18,"Mobile is too good , but product i received faulty , on 2 nd day I connected to charging by keeping g switch off and change sim card . it cant switched on . I placed immediately replacement order and Amazon take it properly. Thanks Amazon. But now I cancelled and all order."
,1,11-Nov-18,"The product was defective. And amazon kept me on wait for 10 days for no reason to replace the phone,even it was manufacturing defects."
,3,08-Nov-18,"I'm a fan of Oneplus. OP 6T is really great in build quality, slightly thicker than oneplus 3 but that feels good in hands. On comparing photos with my OP 3 then OP 6T is a mood off. Also, the finger print scanner animation is very slow. It doesn't give you idea of the instant the phone will get unlocked, eventually making you keep finger for more time. And this happens every time. I still prefer my OP 3 over my dad's OP 6T in terms of low-light photograph and fingerprint. Also, fingerprint animation is poor in UI. Display of phone is nice though."
,5,06-Nov-18,"I am a OnePlus One user who upgraded to this phone. Considering this fact, I am loving this phone. It's been 4 days since I got OnePlus 6T and I have charged only a couple of times for an hour or so each time; the battery is just brilliant. If you are someone who loves to click pictures and take selfies, you won't be disappointed with the various features of the camera in this phone. I got 6 gigs of ram and 128 storage space in this phone, and it's damn quick and no lags or hangs so far! If you don't like the notch, not to worry, you will be able to disable it.

One major disappointment was the 3.5mm jack's death. However, with their Type-C headphone adapter, you can manage to plug in your 3.5mm headphones.

Lastly, if you are someone who's upgrading from OnePlus 3rd Gen., 5th Gen., or 6, consider waiting for the next phone from OnePlus."
,5,28-Nov-18,"The phone is really good,I bought this phone for gaming and i was satisfied with its performance camera quality is good but not great but i dont care because i am not photographer battery is mind blowing and i love the dash charger display is great easily visible in sun light and the auto brightness works really good the ram management is really great the oxygen os is really a great skin but the in display fingerprint doesnt work well but the face unlock works really good in darkness it uses display as fashlight to unlock"
,2,26-Dec-18,"Lot of issues,
1. Camera gets crashed frequently.
2. Apps crash sometimes.
3. Camera app is dead slow while loading.
4. Picture qlty isn't as expected.
5. Speakers are not good... Voice cracks with half the volume.
6. Gallery crashes sometimes."
,5,09-Nov-18,Well one plus 6T is awesome. It's truly a flagship killer. Camera cud have been a bit better but hey it's ok nothing can be too perfect right??
,2,05-Nov-18,My phone is not having any ringtone.this functionality is not working I have already reported and asked for replacement. Further the set was also not having the pin for sim. It's a terrible experience. Expect immediate action from Amazon and one plus team for replacement of my phone.
,5,04-Nov-18,"performance excellent
Picture quality
Sound quality
Battery life

Single word in oneplus
Awesome"
,5,28-Feb-19,"My review after 4 months of usage.... Fantastic product from oneplus, as usual. I am a fan of this brand and its' products. I have owned oneplus X and then oneplus 3 and now oneplus 6t and believe me there is no match to this machine in this price bracket. It feels like all other brands are cheating Us by selling overpriced similar phones. Zaruri nahi achi cheez mehngi hi ho. Everything is great about this phone. Superb screen, awsome sound quality, awsome camera, great battery life, looks premium , excellent network reception, superb sound quality of both mic and ear piece and speaker, no heating issues, excellent sunlight visibility of screen, great oneplus operating system near stock android ROM experience, regular software updates are being provided, dual 4g volte i.e we can use 2 4g volte sims side by side now. I use airtel and jio sims and both work great parallely. Good quality of back cover is provided with phone in box, usb type c to 3.5mm jack converter is included in box. Dash charger is great as ever. No earphones included in box. Superb quality of usb type c cable. Bought it in first opening sale. Just go for it, no 2nd thaughts. This is best ever mobilephone by oneplus. This is not a paid review so Pls vote the review as helpful if I help you in choosing your product."
,4,01-Dec-18," switched from my iPhone 6S+ to this impressive smartphone. Honestly, it was the most rewarding decision I made. I'm writing this review after using the OnePlus 6T for nearly a month. It's super fast, responsive and the UI is praiseworthy. If you watch any YouTube video comparing the speeds (speed test) of OnePlus 6T vs iPhone XS, it's the former which comes out the fastest.
Note: Amazon Transportation Services (ATS) sucks! Worst delivery service. (Reason for giving only 4 stars)"
,2,07-Nov-18,"I was extremely excited about the product and while I prefer ordered through Amazon gift card and bought it on the launch day. I was extremely dissapointed with Amazon. During the sale the offer showed 3/6 month no cost emi and then when I went ahead with 6 months my bank started to charge 13% interest saying we have already given no cost emi discount and now 13% will be applicable. Don't understand the logical behind it, if you are giving a discount why do you find ways to earn it back with false advertisement. Now, the offer has changed and says that's applicable only for 3 months. This really messed up my experience. I have been a one plus user and purchased the same through Amazon on multiple occasion, dissapointed to see the quality and commitment has gone so down so much."
,3,04-Nov-18,"Not up to the expectation. Too much of hype. Fingerprint scanner is very slow and doesn't work smoothly.
I was waiting for it since 2 months, but turned out to be an average phone."
,5,07-Nov-18,Amazing battery life and a great experience to use it.
,1,23-Dec-18,"I am ratting the Amazon transportation services, worst ever find again and again, I found no scope of improvement with so many compliments. OnePlus should have to go with flipkart for better customer support and services."
,5,04-Nov-18,"This is my first experience with one plus. Good camera, better performance, good screen quality but phone little bit heavy. Go for it."
,4,14-Nov-18,This is really nice product. There are certain drawback like no led notification and no always on display despite having smiled screen. But overall it is very nice and fluid to use. Camera are same as earlier. Night scape mode may not be the best but it still way better than anything else in this price bracket. Mirror black finish also hides the fingerprints to some extent which is also good. Performance and fluid Ness is something which has hooked me for first time for using OnePlus devices. And I must say that it is really fluid and battery life exceptional now with 3700 mah. With moderate usage I am always getting screen on time of anywhere between 6 to 7 hrs so with normal moderate use it will always last you for a day and half. In display fingerprint scanner may not be fastest and always accurate but it is still unique and serve the purpose. Overall a good clean android performance phone to have.
,3,06-Feb-19,"Build quality to hold etc is very good. While it comes prefitted with a screen protector - you will need to add a stronger layer.
Quite thoughtful that they have an adapted for the headphones in the box (since there is no headphone jack)..
The sound quality is very impressive. Whether on Bluetooth speakers or on headsets or just on speaker - simply great quality speakers.
The software is simple android experience so no issues.
Fingerprint scanner is disappointing - surprisingly slow. Also it allows only 3 attempts after which you have to use the password in any case.
Pictures appear good but quite soft. So they don't appear as sharp as the Samsung S8 etc.
Video is really bad. No image stabilization at all even on 1080 resolution. Very disappointed.
All in all - it's a super looking phone with clarity in sound (both speaking and listening), picks up signals bettet than most phones so internet is great even with weak signals, super for music, ok for pictures and bad for video."
,5,09-Mar-19,"OnePlus is the best when it comes to performance in Android. Much better than the pixel phones, which is a shame. I was using OP5 before this for a year and a half before I shattered the screen. So I decided to go for 6t now. To be honest I didn't want to buy a new phone since the old one worked as good as new with no slow downs.
Coming to 6t, this is a powerhouse. Never faced a hiccup in any apps, the camera is above average, but I'm not a photography enthusiast. Gaming performance is epic! And it charges extremely fast thanks to Dash charging.
The only downside to this phone is the slightly slower finger print sensor. You'll notice it if you're coming from older OnePlus devices, which had a lightening fast sensor. But it's nothing you can't get used to.
The notch is one of the most subtle ones on the market.
I would recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a new Android device."
,3,05-Nov-18,i had buyed 6t mobile today and i had puttedlock to it and it had worked for 10 min and after 10 min ph is not opening lock and it is telling incurrect pin and appearing as dummy ph display so plz dont buy this kind of cheap ph friends i had suffered lot and i went to service center to solve my problem they r telling that we dont have this soft ware u directly contact to customer service they wil solve your problem they r telling like that so plz dont buy this kind of stuppid company phones
,5,06-Nov-18,"Migrated from Oneplus 2 to Oneplus 6T and I am happy with the upgrade. After purchasing my first Oneplus 2 3 years before, I became a fan of Oneplus as I never had any issues. Oneplus 6T is having smooth navigation, hell lot of features dont know whether everyone uses all the features or not. Pics taken from the camera are awesome. Battery life is good, super fast charging. Phone size is also good while holding the phone with one hand. Only drawback that I have seen is removal of 3.5mm audio jack, so I have ordered one from oneplus site for 1.5K. Overall its an awesome phone. Thanks for Amazon for a quick delivery."
,4,14-Nov-18,"It is a very amazing device just i would say , it's not a very big upgrade from last device bt still it's very good , the best in market , 1 star has been reduced just because of headphone jack as everyone wants a headphone jack , maximum people i mean. Quality of the product is good , battery life is also good and charging speed is best in class . Camera is also very good and competes against the best of other flagships. Just go for it in this price range , no other phone can be better. 4 stars because there is always a space of improvement and no device is perfect."
,5,09-Dec-18,"If this is what OnePlus are going to offer then I am sold. I think the phone looks absolutely stunning and yet not flashy, it's understated good looks gives it that upmarket feeling. You don't get a flagship device at this rate. I don't change phones frequently so this phone will be with me for atleast 3 years and as it is my first OP device so I will keep it with me. So next Oneplus will be 9 or 10 God willing. But I tested the bullet headphones and they are good but can be much improved. If possible do bring back the headphone jack and led notification. Great Job OP and Amazon."
,5,04-Nov-18,"Loved it, I bought OnePlus Six 3 months ago, I Just now purchased the New One Plus 6t and At this price this Phone is par from even any phone in India , I have used Y1 Y2 Note 5 Pro and Even Mi 3s pri e but Now comparison at all, You Will get the worth of your money."
,5,20-Nov-18,"This is by far the best smartphone in the market in this budget, beating certain devices with prices 10k higher than this. Specially after the software updates and inclusion of night scape mode in camera, this phone feels like premium butter wrapped in a velvet foil.
Excellent touch
Great battery
Great camera
Superb OxygenOS (as always)
Snappy performance
Great gaming experience including PUBG and Asphalt
I am not a wired heatset user so the removal of headphone jack didn't really effect me.

Worth every penny you spend.... And more."
,5,04-Nov-18,"Wow what a phone!!!!
Flagship by one plus.
Pros.
1. Ultimately battery life. Last one full day.
2. Superb camera.
3. Drop notch.
4. Screen finger print touch sensor. (Pretty fast).
5. More screen less bezel.
Cons.
1. Night mode not as great as expected.
2. Same design nd processor as one plus 6.
3. Face recognition not as good in dim light conditions."
,1,26-Dec-18,"Product, zero out of 10
Don't buy 6T
For all oneplus user don't move from oneplus 5 or 5T to 6T
"
,5,31-Dec-18,"The One Plus McLaren edition is amazing no doubt about that the only issue I have is the warranty card and pin ejector are missing from the package box. I didn't shoot the unboxing video assuming there won't be any problem.
So the only concern of mine is whether the warranty card will be provided or not; if not then at the service center what document should I provide for any services that I would be needing during the warranty period."
,4,08-Nov-18,"Everything is good about the phone but the in-display fingerprint sensor is substantially not accurate and consistent. OnePlus should have gone with the physical fingerprint reader and should have waited for the new Qualcomm 3rd gen in-display fingerprint sensor.
OnePlus actually made its phone slower with this in-display technology by implementing it too soon.

Camera is great as it is always been but the night mode shots are with the night mode is not good at all and infact the normal camera mode in the night will give you better shots as compared to the night mode."
,5,02-Feb-19,"Great device. Amazing speed. 8gb ram and superior processor work at lightning fast speed. I play a lot of online games and with this device I can open multiple games without worrying about device slowing down. On my previous phones, the games always caused issues like heating of device, device becoming abnormally slow and rapid battery discharge. This device solved all my issues. I have used fast charging devices as well but the speed of charging of this device is the best among any I have come across till date."
,4,05-Nov-18,"Oneplus 6T is the best phone you can get with less than half the price of iPhones.
All the features are really good. Oneplus has been consistent in upgrading their brand & added new features into their phones. I am skipping the PROs of the phone(which is a huge list, already described by many ppl)
CONs:
Fingerprint sensor - slower than previous models + you need the screen to be switched on before using the fingerprint
Headphone jack removed & extension chord is provided. This is a big let down!
Tq"
,5,07-Nov-18,"UNLOCK THE SPEED!
Indeed this phone is massively fast!
First impression whoever holds this device is gets that... so smooth and fast!
Face unlock - less then a sec, barely you will see lockscreen
InDisplay Finger Print - Fast (when done properly) and in my fav position. as I mostly use my phone laying down on a surface( table,bed etc)
Camera - Awesome (not a fan of protrait mode but its better then so many phones out there)
Battery - Lasts longer.
Display - very good, notch is invisible while viewing videos.
Notch is sexy!
Screen is large but with good viewing angles
Overall - A must buy phone"
,1,07-Nov-18,"Camera flash is not working
Disappointed from One + 6T ...."
,5,04-Jan-19,"I've always been a OnePlus fan since the days of OnePlus One. I progressed to OnePlus 3, 3T and am now on 6T. Never been disappointed with the hardware and the software. It's blazing fast, nimble, ok with poking around the innards and simply DDG in appearance.

My sons with their Samsung Note 8 and Galaxy 9 are insanely jealous of my 6T. I don't have to say anything more"
,5,04-Nov-18,"This is my first experience with one plus .
One plus 6t is pretty impressive. Gud battery backup , finger print scanner is real quick , display is amazing , camera is mind blowing,......... Now waiting for the bullet earphones ."
,1,17-Dec-18,"I was using 3T from past 2 years and my experience was Good, But this phone is not working fine, it hangs a lot and I can see a black and white screen with dots on it often. The camera quailty is okish because you see grains in the backcamer images which is annoying. I am not happy with this Product. The fact that this is a new piece and it hangs a lot bothers me because it has not been a month also. the fingure print scanner is also not that great 3t was way more better"
,5,08-Nov-18,"I purchased a 6GB, 128GB phone. I m using the dual camera lens for the first time and noticed some objects getting out of focus in the auto mode. Sound quality is same as before with very little improvement. However, OLED display is certainly good with natural colors. The phone came with pre attached screen guard which absorbs lot of prints requiring frequent cleaning. In screen fingerprint sensor works well. Face recognition is snappy. One plus phones are fast and don't lag like Samsung/Iphone even after 2 years of use."
,5,22-Dec-18,"Oneplus has proved with their Oneplus 6T that you don't need to grab an anount of 1 lakh from customers to deliver a premium phone with possibly the best version of Android. I have used iphone XS and my only gripe about this phone is the lack of stereo speakers. That said, that's the only complaint. Otherwise I am extensively impressed by this phone and especially by its display panel and software. I have used latest androidone phones but this ""oxygen os"" version of pure android is very fluid and beautiful to the eyes. This is my first oneplus phone and I expect them to provide software updates in the long run. That said, I was even more surprised to see it being declared as smartphone of the year by MKBHD the day after I got my oneplus! Happy!"
,5,19-Dec-18,"The display is bright and has got some really good colors. Sound quality is decently loud(just be careful not to cover up your speaker). Since I got my hands on my phone day before yesterday, I haven't given it a rest. After a day's use with reasonable screen brightness(about 75%) and screen on time just above 5 hours, I ended up with 50% juice left. And the warp charging speed is just as promised. I was surprised to see that the battery drained only up to 3% over night. Nightscape in the stock camera is not as good as that in the pixel 3. But I downloaded the pixel 3 gcam mod and it's working just fine."
,4,19-Feb-19,"One Plus became my favourite brand since I used OP 6 for 4 months. After only 4 months of use I exchanged it with OP 6T Maclaren edition. Though I haven't received a good value of my 4 months old OP6 but I gladly accepted it for this special edition. Incredible phone I can say in one word. Oxygen OS is fluidic and they are working heard to make it even better everyday. 10 gb of RAM and 256 gb storage is more than enough for me. And what a look in back side. Presentation is also remarkable. But I really miss the notification LED and 3.5 mm headfone jack of my OP 6. But I had to consider it with bigger battery and better display of 6t maclaren. Oh... I forgot the wrap charge, incredible and specially work with 6t maclaren and not with normal 6t. Much faster than OP regular dash charge. A sample photo attached for understanding bokeh effect and picture quality."
,1,11-Nov-18,Worst camera quality gives colour issues
,3,15-Nov-18,"I think der is no pretty much change in upgrading from OnePlus 6to 6T,but d product is gud if u get used to it.The Indisplay fingerprint sensor is lagging in terms of speed.pictures r good but capturing of image is slow so u may get blurred or shaky images..battery life is good..n sound system is better..hope OnePlus solves d issues in next updates"
,4,15-Nov-18,"Oneplus always rocks! Been using it since Nov 2, 2018, I just love it! I'm oneplus user since 2015, camera has improved a lot, still cannot match Iphone quality. yet, compared to all other phones(except Iphone), 6T camera is way too good. Audio quality, Performance and battery life are awesome!

Only con I see is this phone is heavy."
,5,08-Nov-18,"Purchased the Midnight Black with 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage. A premium smart phone which is sleek, fast and good looking. Have been using the system for nearly a week and am very impressed with the performance of the phone. Battery charge is holding for a good 2 days and thanks to super fast charging, it gets charged soon. Have been watching videos and playing games like Asphalt 9, Need for speed, Fifa. The Graphics and performance is very good. Sound quality is good. Haven't noticed any heating issues so far.
Impressed by the on screen fingerprint scanner. Face detection is also awesome. Haven't noticed any lag.
Call quality is very good.
Overall a very good, solid built phone"
,5,03-Mar-19,"I am writing this review after using the phone for more than 2 weeks,16 days to be more accurate.Everything about this phone is awesome,the battery backup,the photos quality,the screen quality,the sound quality,the appearance, everything is just amazing. Previously i was using ios and samsung but trust me this is the phone which i feel is the closest to perfection.I am totally in love with it.It has everything you can ask for in a smartphone and even more.Being an ios and samsung user previously,i can say that i am enjoying oneplus 6t more than i enjoyed using ios and samsung.
"
,2,18-Nov-18,"Don't buy this phone. You can buy any other phone in range 20k and get good performance than buying this phone for its bad performance. The camera quality is very poor, after zooming the picture is blurred and is worst. This phone's battery is also draining very fast. The sound quality of the speaker is heard only when the speakers are at Full volume. The performance of the camera in night is also very poor"
,5,05-Nov-18,"I had 3 doubts before buying
1. Speakers - they are loud enough almost as per many dual speaker phones
2. Notch - this phone hides the notch pretty well.
3. Headphone jack - easily survived 4 days with the adapter always fixed to my headphone wire. Now I don't even remember what headphone jack was. Also, adapter are available at very cheap rates everywhere.

Phone is superb & please do not conpare it with poco. Oxygen OS is far superior."
,2,09-Mar-19,"Does not use global standard power pin. It is big. U need to carry it, means uou cannot use others in case you forgot.

Head set jack and space is not available. Mean you have tk use the oneplus specific adaptor if you want to use.

Power charging is not that fast. It took me 3 hours to charged and already half is gone within 3 hours.

Some of the app was not working

It is diagonally 6.4. but actually some where near to 5.5 horizonal.

Yhe finger print reader is overlapping the keyboard. Many time finger print does not recognise.

Do not recommend. Lost my huge money"
,5,11-Nov-18,"Marvelous and simply awesome mobile. No heating issue, long lasting battery, picture quality is superb
Fingerprint scanner is little slow but overall nice product."
,4,16-Feb-19,"Pros: Works as described, battery is much improved over a OnePlus 3T which is what this phone has replaced. Much smoother to operate too.

Cons: The display is not great compared to other mobiles that are in similar price range or slightly more expensive.

Other thoughts: Not a worthwhile upgrade from a OnePlus 5T which is also what i own"
,1,20-Feb-19,The one plus smartphone is horrible and defective smartphone..i am talking about the entire model not one unit....the basic functiono the phone is to call and get calls...but that itself is not working within 2 months of buying it...i have seen this same problem in one plus 5t and one plus 5 in brand new pieces like within a week but i thought its a software problem and will be solved but its there till now in one plus 6t...the company is sellong faulty phones or amazon is selling faulty phones...either of the 2 definitely...DONT BUY THIS PHONE OR ANY OTHER PHONE OF ONE PLUS....HUGE WARNING FOR PEOPLE READING THIS REVIEW AND AMAZON YOU BETTER READ THIS REVIEW AND CORRECT YOURSELF..
,5,19-Jan-19,"Best thing about this phone is the software..it's better optimized than pixel 3.you can install Google cam if u want Google nightmode.. great performance and premium looks in a unbetable price..trust me pocophone doesn't even compare to the fluidity and usability of oxygen OS..been using it for 3monts no problems faced.. great community support is also present and you get regular monthly updates..will highly recommend to buy it..it's oled pannel also supports hdr..and playing pubg on it will make your friends more than jealous..the fast charger is to die for...just one hour of charge last 24 hours with screen on time 7hours plus..and 10hours if it's in battery saver..the hardware is great but the software is where OnePlus is leading..it's oxygen OS is better than stock Android it has global dark mode, inbuilt applocker ,touch ID support, AR support any many more awesome features..my best purchase to date."
,5,06-Nov-18,"Bought it for 29165/- (Redmi note 5 exchange + 2000 instant discount on ICICI card + 1000 cash back at Amazon pay) on the day of its launch.

It's been 4 days with this phone and the experience is great.

Pros:

1) The on-screen fingerprint is fast enough
2) Excellent display
3) Great battery life (Getting 1.5-2 days)
4) Superb build quality
5) Android Pie out of the box
6) 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 6 screen
7) 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM on base 6T version.
8) Comes with DASH charger which will charge your mobile from 0-100% in 1.5 hrs.
9) No sign of heating during heavy usage
10) Speaker sound quality is good and loud enough.
11) Both Front and the Rear camera takes very good pictures

Cons:

1) No 3.5mm jack ( An extra connecter will be provided in the box to connect 3.5mm jack headphone).
2) No wireless charging.
3) It has a glass back which means a fingerprint magnet. We should use back case( you will get a good quality back case in the box).
4) It has 6.4-inch screen. Not for people with small hands.
5) No notification light

This phone is an excellent value for money. Just go for it, you will never regret."
,5,08-Nov-18,"Hi all ,this is a review after 3 months of use of this phone...well I sold it on olx and I am back in my fav iOS .....well why I sold
1) doesn’t liked using android ...wasn’t able to adjust to the android at all ,so those who are iOS user for long time better go for iPhone .
2) phone doesn’t give he premium feel that an iPhone or Samsung high end phones gives
3) ahhh well I don’t like this big phone too big for my liking
4)horrible speaker at this price
Now about the phone ...camera is avrg ...battery is good , charging is super fast
No lags on the phone , one of the best phone for android update users , oxygen os is better I feel
Final ....if one is iOS user stick to iPhone , if u love android then this is the best thing u can have"
,1,06-Nov-18,No earphone and no case cover in this cover so it's absolutely fake products ..it has a big cheating to as…
,5,17-Dec-18,"One Plus 6T is an amazing phone for speed and performance and camera quality. It also has a very good battery backup and can easily go upto 1.5 days at least with day long internet browsing and video streaming and music. If you are a hard core gamer like me, you can definitely count on this phone! Great gaming performance without lag or heating issues and can easily support hours of gaming time without charging. I have been using this for about 15-20 days now and am already a big fan of this One Plus device. This is my 2nd One Plus phone and they have proved it again that this really is a flagship killer!"
,4,04-Nov-18,Really like the product. There are very minute changes between the 6 and 6T. If you have the 6 then this product isn't a big upgrade however if you are planning to buy this phone as an upgrade from say the 5 then yes it surely is a steal deal. The in screen finger sensor is rather slow but the face unlock compensates this. I personally use only Bluetooth but users may find the headphone jack not being there as an inconvenience. The connector that's been provided works wonders and if you look at it in a better way Bluetooth headphones have now become cheaper in today's world. Over all I would say 4.5 as the inscreen sensor is a little slow but I'm sure they would work on this feature soon.
,2,07-Mar-19,"Camera is just average despite dual lens and what not. If your reason to upgrade is camera then don't. I moved to 6T from my 3T and that is not the best decision. Compared to 3T's aluminium body 6T is all glass which is very fragile. 6T is bulky like hell. Battery life is very good. On my normal usage it lasts around 2 days. Speed is good but that also depends on internet speed.
"
,4,14-Feb-19,Had to return the entire handset due to faulty charger. The replacement unit was good. Phone was compared with iphone 6s and Honor 10. In all aspects it is better than iPhone 6s and even iphone 8 in some aspects but speed wise it was same as Honor 10. The image quality is same as on the honor 10 in some cases honor 10 images were better. Video picture quality i felt was better on H10 but the overall stabilisation is much better on Oneplus 6t. Where it beats the h10 is the selfie camera. Battery life slightly less than H10 due to screen size. Screen quality is only slightly better than H10. If this helps.
,4,05-Nov-18,Top notch all round performance!!
,5,04-Nov-18,"The best part of the phone is its display along with the in display fingerprint sensor and the aesthetically pleasing notch. Battery life has improved quite a bit from the last gen op5t and 6. Oxygen OS continuee to be the best android experience imo. Only if they could have been a little more aggressive about the pricing, it would be a bang for the buck. Camera quality is decent but expected bit more of it. Video quality is great."
,5,28-Nov-18,"Dislike first:
* No headphone jack (you do getva converter though)
* No card slot
* Slightly slower fingerprint unlocking than hardware

But other than that, super fast and amazing phone

Some additional things i do like:
* In built app cloning (run 2 instances of same app)
* In built app lock (however it uses same password as screen lock)"
,5,06-Nov-18,"Over the past couple of years, every phone that OnePlus has made has indeed been incrementally better than the previous one it makes. That can be traced back from the time the OnePlus 3T succeeded the OnePlus 3—which was already a very good phone at the time. This unflinching consistency has paid dividends here too. The OnePlus 6 was already a great phone to own, and the subtle changes make the OnePlus 6T even better in many respects—the foremost being the new Android on board, and the improved camera. The thing is, if you have already invested in a OnePlus 6, you really don’t need to rush to buy the 6T. But for anyone else looking for a genuine upgrade over their existing phone, this is ticking off all the boxes."
,5,21-Jan-19,"I was using iPhone X and wanted to buy a phone having dual sim, good performance with decent camera and vanilla experience of an OS. 6t came around during that time and got it with a good exchange price for an older phone. I was pretty impressed how far one plus has come from one plus 1. Everything was very good with this phone except the picture quality but then I just put GCam version from XDA for One plus and viola more information get pixel quality pics. Headphone jack is something that I kind of miss though I have many Bluetooth headsets but there are still places where a headphone jack comes handy. Loved the Amoled display as well but is not one of the brightest under direct sunlight but it still maintain its colours under sun unlike Mi phone that gets completely washed out."
,5,08-Nov-18,Amazing Phone.. I Recommended you to if you have 40 Thousands You can Go with OnePlus 6T. and UNLOCK THE SPEED 
,5,27-Jan-19,"The phone is good, it performs well and is fast the finger print sensor is a little slower than I expected it to be i believe the OnePlus 2 has a better finger print scanner, the facial recognition however is on point it recognizes and unlocks faster than the fingerprint scanner, the pictures quality is very clean and clear in bright light at night it still takes good pictures but dosent seem to do well in dark lighting, battery life is good and charges very fast, all in all i am satisfied with my purchase i absolutely love the phone."
,5,10-Nov-18,"What an amazing device. The price is justified what it offers. Believe me it may not be a better looking phone out there among the flagships, but I bet it's a better phone to live with compared to others, the reason being the polished software. It's a low priced pixel, with more functionality. The super slow motion is great. The notch in fact is it's beauty spot. Display is great. Camera good. In display finger print reader works like a charm. Battery life amazing. Personally my only complaint is huge size of the phone."
,2,21-Jan-19,"A month before I purchased this phone from amazon.in. It is a good phone with great battery backup and also quickly charges for which I like this phone very much. The phone never get hangs or heats at all. Display quality is good. Camera quality is average. Youtube videos misguides people as it's camera is shown great there but actually image quality of selfie camera is poor and very cheap. Even vivo v11 pro has much better selfie camera with lot of details and also costs you nearly half price than one plus 6t. You can also face some software lags in OnePlus. Phone is little bit heavier but ok. However built quality of handset is good.
Overall it is not a good value for money. As phone and it's accessories are bit costly. I personally recommend you to go with vivo v11 pro, Samsung A8 or go with Vivo nex or iphone and don't spend on this phone."
,4,19-Jan-19,"I have been a OnePlus user for a long time. Purchased OnePlus one through invite system in earlier days. Had it for 3years. OnePlus 6t lives up to the reputation. Great display, great battery life. Google night cam makes the camera even better. Clicks Good pics in day light n night.
Sound quality could have been better
Biggest con according to me is the in display fingerprint sensor. It takes multiple attempts more than often n sometimes unlocks with other people finger prints who are just checking out this new feature. Bit embarrassing. Much more of a gimmick than safety.
Other than that a great phone to have at this price range."
,5,10-Nov-18,"The phone is really great and have some lot of intresting features.
Pros:
The dash charging has a jaw dropping speed.
The face unlock is also quiet fast.
Android Pie + Oxygen Os makes the phone smooth and easy to use.
Cons:
The Screen is a fingerprint magnet.
The brightness is not quiet bright.
The battery life may not be enough for a gamer.
There are some issues with the calls.As it is filled with weird sounds."
,1,10-Jan-19,"I had got the first unit replaced due to an issue with Airtel 4G, the phone was not able to catch 4G signal. The second phone replaced also had the same issue and moreover in the second one there was gap between the frame and the back glass( Gap was wide enough for any water drop to get into the phone ). Was high on expectation when i bought this phone. It was such a big disappointment to see such a faulty product delivered twice. Oneplus forums have multiple complaints raised on the 4G issue...."
,4,04-Nov-18,"I like the phone very much. Messages option is very nice. Sending all notifications under one category. But it would be better you should have provided FM(Radio) default app also. Also all the pics if displayed at one place will be easier. Now we have to go to collections and search if we require any pic that was sent from friends.
I didn't understand how the second camera works. If there is no option of changing camera, what is the use of giving 2 cameras backside?"
,1,16-Dec-18,"The product is a big failure I have ordered this phone twice from Amazon but both times I faced this voice echo issue on Airtel network during phone calls, even after changing the sim card.

All my callers are complaining about this and most of them have even stopped calling on this phone and call me instead on my 5 year old iphone.
on top of all this the terrible support team of oneplus who do not have the basic courtesy of responding on emails. Thr service center is equally pathetic with untrained, rude guys who are not ready to help either. HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY"
,5,11-Nov-18,This mobile is the best I have ever seen before... Picture quality and speed are awesome.. Sound is bit louder. Battery is the main perspective for me and it fulfilled that with great battery life.... Gaming experience is super graphics are awesome and not hanging even if it's a full graphical game. Camera is good. Overall it's the best.
,4,16-Nov-18,Pretty good mobile if you are going to upgrade from earlier versions. Sound output by using the USB c adapter is not great. Picture quality on natural light is awesome better than other mobiles like note9 or iPhone. In low light it struggles night mode just increases the saturation and exposure. Battery life better than previous models. Don't be color specific it won't matter anyways you will end buying a back cover.
,5,04-Nov-18,"Amazon delivered this beauty ontime. This is my first OnePlus device and I am just loving it. The device is very smooth and performance is crisp. Only issue I am facing is with the battery life, it's draining very fast and surprisingly Google Play is consuming maximum power. I hope OnePlus will fix this with an update. Also, I am really impressed with the fast charging in this phone, it's superfast. Highly recommended."
,3,04-Jan-19,"Issues:
1)Camera: Not good as specified/ expected
2)Proximity sensor: Phone automatically switches ON Bluetooth,WiFi, etc while talking.
3)Finger sensor: Have to wait to unlock the phone. Immediately removing after the touch , unlock won't work.
4) Colour of phone: 1+ should create more colours like APPLE.
5) Seperate Jack for earphone: Not available.
6) Battery heat while charging with power bank

In this range 38K above issues should not be there..... Needs improvement from 1+"
,5,25-Nov-18,"Had been using one plus two since 2016 without any problem ever ....but needed more memory , so decided to go for 6t . The exchange and delivery was glitch free & then the phone is a dream ....good look, great speed , awesome cameras , sharp clicks, night view , ease of operation ...what more does one need .
Now after less than two months , I wake one morning to find power button not working and battery showing 100% & charging even when not connected to charger . No service centre in Bihar , have to go to WB for repair."
,5,18-Dec-18,Excellent phone though I’m having a challenge getting used to an android system after using an iPhone for years. I bought it as I believe it has a far superior camera to my iPhone 7. Also I got a good deal in the exchange for my old iPhone 5s 16 GB though the delivery agent seemed to be dishonest and wanted me to give him the charger and cable when the exchange deal clearly mentioned that it was not compulsory. The 1500 cash back from Citibank and the no cost emi made it very affordable
,5,04-Jan-19,"Switched from Samsung S6. Damn happy to switch to OP.
Best battery life.
Best performance.
Amazing camera both rear and front.
Nice built in features like phone mode change slider, call record etc.
Superb screen.
Complete button less onscreen handling with new gestures......and list goes on.
I bet nobody can ever regret buying this beast, not sure about iphones but surely better option than Samsung counterparts at this price."
,3,04-Nov-18,As mentioned in the subjects is no doubt a masterpiece product... but just a suggestion don't go for the exchange offer!!! Reason being the delivery guy drops in at 8am in the morning and does not wait cause he is in a hurry I needed to check the product wasn't even ready to handover my phone because it had all the data ...lost most of it thanks to the delivery boy so had a very bad experience before even getting my new 6t phone
,4,04-Nov-18,Camera work comparatively compromising with iphones else best flagship phone yet
,5,29-Nov-18,"Battery life is awesome. On heavy usage battery will stand for a day. On minimal usage, battery will stands for easily 2 days. Apart from the DASH charging is awesome. To charge a whole 3700 MAH battery, charging takes around 1 hour 10 minutes. Thanks to DASH charging.
Picture quality - it is good when compared to Mobile at this prices ranga. Nightscape mode is good. Oxygen OS updates has been released to make the camera battery.
Sound Quality - it's good and can't expect more. Value for Money.
Final Tip. Don't compare the OnePlus 6T with Samsung Galaxy s9, Google pixel 3, Apple 8, X, XS. They are really very expensive when compared to OnePlus 6T. In this budget, OnePlus is the best available option. Bang for bucks."
,4,31-Dec-18,"When I got this product i was very doubtful about the fingerprint sensor .It still a hit or miss but works like a charm 90% of the time.The battery quality is damn good ?? and as for the UI it's super smoooth,speakers could have been better,camera is good only performs average on low lightings.The only cons for me was not providing a headphone jack,apart from that it's a good phone to consider under 40K,and gaming is damn good on this device,i got nearly 4hr screen on time while playing pubg continously(wouldn't recommend playing this long though) and due to dash charge low battery is not an issue."
,5,02-Jan-19,Battery is good. Camera is awesome. Speaker is loud and clear. Face unlock is good than expected. It would have been better if face unlock works in low light. Slow motion is awesome. Night mode is good. Could be better too. But night mode is not necessary as this phone has awesome flash... 1x zoom is good. Display is perfect. Smooth performance. No hearing issues at all.. it goes from 10 to 100 % charge in 1hour...
,5,10-Jan-19,"I am using this phone from past 6-7 days.
One of the biggest concern which everybody have is battery life. This beast has a great battery life. On moderate use the battery lasted for almost 25-26 Hours without charging. I am getting 7.30-8 hrs of on screen time usage in a single charge.
It might be possible that some people might have received faulty piece due to which they are facing battery drain issues.

The sound is quite loud despite the fact that it has got only a single speaker.

The only thing which is bothering is the screen brighness issue. One needs to keep the phone's brightness to almost 70-80% to view the screen in the sunny conditions outside but I suppose there should be a fix for this issue sometime soon.

The build quality of the phone and camera quality is great.

So whomsoever wishes to get a new phone, this would make a perfect choice."
,5,08-Nov-18,This phone is a beast to say the least. SD 845 processor can handle anything and everything thrown at it. It's butter smooth and looks very classy. All glass body looks very premium in nature. Battery has not been that good since I have been using it. Maybe it is due to some rogue app draining it faster. Nevertheless it's a complete package from OnePlus. I've been a loyal OnePlus user since the day they launched in India. They never disappoint their customers to say the least. This latest offering from OnePlus is surely the best they have had till date.
,1,21-Nov-18,Got a defect one.. at right top you can find a dot which inside the screen !! onlynd out only after I removed the scratch card. My piece of advice for everyone kindly buy the product in authorized one plus show room or experience center. Because you don't have to loose your money like me. Even this defect is found by the one plus show room guy. They showed me that screen is defect. We buy one product for 38k but didn't know whether the new one is in good condition or not. So better buy in retail store where we can experience it . Alast don't loose money like me . I even asked them no option of return. Only to change the screen . You know once to done something like that. You loose the feel of Special.Atleast it is my feel.Dont forget to remove the scratch card as soon as you bought the device .
,2,22-Jan-19,"I opened the seal and tried to charge the mobile i t was charged for 2 min and so and stopped charging,
when I used the charger for another mobile it was working and when I used another charger for the mobile, mobile too was charging, I don't know what the technical issue was with the product, I tried contacting the customer care and they ran some tests and the mobile failed the test and it was returned, everything was OK.

As a genuine customer what worries me is, what if the test that was run in the mobile has shown me otherwise, what should I have done then."
,3,04-Nov-18,There is no notification led... I really don't like the animation in the finger print censor. Expected slimmer phone . But one plus 6t feels heavy !!!
,5,26-Dec-18,The product and its packing is very good.....only the minus point is one plus is not providing its own earphone with its smart phones..kindly look into and do the needful next time...a good phone without earphone is not suitable...i am using my vivo earphone with it which is also a wonderful experience....but is it ok?? one plus smart phone with vivo earphone what i am using???waiting for next time.....with something more surprising from one plus
,4,30-Dec-18,"Lock / Unlock...Sometimes this new phone hangs when we unlock . Does not recognise finger or face both or does not even sense touch screen.. Then whats the difference between a samsung old phone and a new One plus 6 T ?!!!

Camera is Good, but low light is still a problem

Cornilla Glass - my phone's screen is chipped out a bit on the left edge on its own with one month's usage, Not sure if the company will replace free of cost?

Applications are fast in this 8 GB RAM phone. Full Thums Up!

Sound quslity does not match to a Samsung Note or S7

Battrey life is Good for a full day use and charges quickly"
,5,26-Dec-18,"Used it for a day, the performance is great, but all new device will work smoothly for initial days.
The total usable RAM is ~9.63 GB, out of which ~5.032 GB shows available in normal operations (as per Antutu app).

Sound quality is loud and clear, the rear camera picture quality is great, but I didn't find the front-facing camera that great given for the price of Phone.

Overall it's just OnePlus 6t with extra RAM.

I attached my Antutu benchmark scores and ranking ( I am currently at Rank #4)."
,5, 9-nov-18,"As we all know, OnePlus had never disappointed it's customers. The only disappoint I had while buying this was, my OnePlus 6 was valued only for 9000. This shows how drastic the price of OnePlus can go down. Apart from this, the phone is completely similar to OnePlus 6 interns of build quality and performance. The due drop display has no special features. Just a apparel stuff. The fingerprint sensor in the front has both upside and downside. The upside is ease to use but the downside is, if your display breaks then you should be ready to pay a lot."
,5,16-Nov-18,Very nice phone as expected from the tech giants.Battery life is good not best I can say despite of increased capacity.It is hell fast and smooth.Camera quality is awesome.Sound is loud and clear.Fingerprint sensor needs a bit improvement.I am quite satisfied with these phone.Would definitely recommend if u want good processor and performance in this budget
,2,04-Nov-18,I didnt realize display is rounded. Looks odd.
,4,20-Dec-18,"Pros:

All that is mentioned in comments, you will find pros common between all phones.. important are cons.

Cons:

-Battery life is not that good.. looks manageable but people who are using phones like Moto or Nokia or Samsung etc they will have tough time with the battery with this one.
-Camera is good but slo-mo and night mode are not that good.. honestly I didn't even liked night mode at all.. rest of the nodes are excellent."
,1,05-Mar-19,"It has a lot of software issues like I've never been able to connect to other devices on share it and xender(still trying to connect of 4 months of usage of this device, frustrated) .
Also it always gets stuck on a percentage when downloading big apples like pubg(like getting stuck after downloading 80% of pubg and failing.. I've used tens of gbs of data to download pubg once. I've tried every possible solution given in reddit, quora, youtube, but there seem to be no permanent solution. :""( even my old Motorola g4 didn't give me as much headache as this phone gave me. I regret buying this phone and wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
,4,04-Nov-18,"No more doubt this device will deserve 5 star. But yesterday only I received the delivery. While charging and playing the games it will reching up 44 degree Celsius. Present I am having both op5 and op 6t op 5 is very even charging or playing game it will not crossed the 34 degree Celsius.
But 6t is heating rapidly. Normal time it will in 33 c like only"
,5,13-Jan-19,"Hi
Writing this after using OnePlus 6t a month as my primary device.
Well nothing new from OnePlus.... simply the Best in class...for a price range of 42k u get best Processer in the Business ..... Amazing battery life ... Super Dash Charge...... Smooth oxygen Is experience and a Good Camera For sure...
I can never get wrong after buying this Beast...
Hart's off OnePlus."
,5,05-Dec-18,"As per 1+ add Never settle, I believe in it n it's my second phone of same brand. Build quality of 1+ phones r very good. After using my last phone around 2 years, I bout it in first day first sale. Best things I got promotion advantage like RS 1500 cash back n Head phone of RS 1500 RS free, I bought this phone 8gb ram n 128 gb configuration. It's amazing, if in future there is new phone of same brand coming I will buy that one as well. I love this device very much"
,4,05-Nov-18,"Excited to purchase with exchange which was smooth. No complains on that front. On using the phone for the last 12 hours, really fast and smooth with very fast processor and no lag even on multi tasking. No heating issues as such so far. Only thing that I felt could have been better was weight of the phone, which is slightly on the higher side. Will update later"
,5,04-Nov-18,"Switched from I phone to this one, indeed this phone offers lot of features which an iOS user can't think of.
UI of iOS is better however if you have budget to buy an I phone with larger memory only then go for it else this one is way better"
,1,06-Nov-18,Worst product as per its price...not value for money...not as per expectations...screen lock is worst in both finerprint and face...front camera is poor…
,5,04-Nov-18,"Great phone, nice features set just as one plus 6.
But having used oneplus 6 for a couple of months before buying this I would say that after a few days of using this the novelty has worn off, meaning that the basic difference between two phones which is of finger scanner is not a big deal after a few days into usage.

Other than that the phone is rock solid,, better battery, don't miss the headphone jack, notch is smaller phone more heftier (good).
A brilliantly packaged phone none the less."
,1,08-Mar-19,"Waste of buying this mobile. I had heard a lot about this one plus and I was so eager to this mobile. But finally I bought this mobile and coming to this performance, I was facing a lot difficulties in smooth running and some times it start hanging and I can’t even play pubg game. While playing pubg I can overdrive some breaking of networks and touch is not so good and smooth. We need to handle so harsh as ordinary mobiles. Finally processing speed does even match with my iPhone 7.
Don’t ever buy mobiles by these publicity stuns by showing lots of features in your hand without any stuff in it. I hope you all can know better about it by asking your friend, those who are using this one plus 6t ."
,1,24-Dec-18,"It is my first one plus mobile but I am very disappointed . My mobile battery has ben drained very instantly . 100% to 7% battery remain screen time only 5 hrs . No running application in background and no mobile data, no screen on but 5% to 7% battery has been drain . I contact with amazon technician two times first time technician told me one anti virus install and check it . I do it but no virus seen . Second times technician make me understand that battery drain is normal issue. I know that and all smartphone user know that . But instantly battery drain not a normal issue. Is not it ?? 39k mobile battery screen on time only 5 hrs !!! Is not laughter . Plz replace my mobile as early as possibl"
,4,06-Nov-18,"Camera I am still exploring how to improve pics as I still find note 8 taking better pics, but rest of features are just too good. Screen sensor is lightening fast, phone is very responsive. Battery backup is decent (far better than my note 8). Other missing area is notification alert"
,5,17-Nov-18,"Amazing looks, sturdy build quality as always,superb camera and android 9 based cyanogen OS,large almost notch less display. Super fast in-display finger print scanner,and best of all amazing amazon prime delivery speed( the cherry on the to..!!).
Got the top model (8+256) model in super sleek midnight black color. !! Just cant stop looking at it. Overall , a right decision to upgrade from my One Plus 5 (8+128) to this one. Kudos One Plus team and Team Amazon"
,2,08-Nov-18,"I recently bought one plus6t. After two days of use it's got started hanging. I didn't downloaded any thing,storages is also free.
Picture quality is average when compared to other low budget phones in the market.
Finger print unlock is slower then face unlock.
Audio quality is very poor, low mids are clashing.
Phone is not up to the mark."
,5,01-Dec-18,Damn ...this phone fabulous there's no reason not to go for it ...it's very snappy to the touch no lag...the game play is awesome multitasking is butter smooth ....thanks to Amazon for making such a beauty and a beast available on its site for purchase ....and awesome work from OnePlus they Rock....wen it comes to camera it worth every penny it may not be as good as a pixel keep in mind a pixel is a thousand dollar phone number this ranks in 549 starting which is just ground breaking love this phone and love OnePlus ...they earned a new customer ????
,2,08-Nov-18,"Camera quality is not up to the mark, fingerprint on screen is slow and not at all convenient.
Price is also too much high. Not at all value for money."
,3,13-Jan-19,"Although I had heard a lot about this monster but could find worth for amount spent. Picture quality and sound quality is very nice battery life is awesome but while ring tone starts some faulty noise comes and hardware lagging issue is seen some time once in a week. camera quality is not so good, lens could have been more powerful For Distant sceens . Sound is loud enough for a descent phone. Sound like non branded chinese sets . U can see a system msg for software update regularly why is this essential for a new 2months old phone company should have updated it before delivery."
,3,11-Dec-18,"Phone is great.
Recommend for user who don't have previously version of one plus phone.
But this phone actually doesn't have any major update from previous phone.
In display finger print scanner is tricky.. it will work fine most of case. But will be slow, thanks for animation.
Face recognizing is not secure, it is not using IR or 3d. Just cam , but it is fast.
Over all phone is good. But you can wait for next release if it's not urgent"
,2,04-Nov-18,it has started hanging now . Even before 2 months from date of purchase
,5,14-Nov-18,"Oneplus 6t is super fast, smooth and it's really snappy..when it comes to display it's bigger and subtle and battery life is really good and with gaming mode in this phone it runs game super smooth with no lags at all and camera is capable of taking really good pictures nd capturing fine details, every mode in the camera works perfectly...so yeah basically this is an all rounder beast..so if you are looking for a smartphone that is worth every penny you spend then just go for it no need to think trust me bcoz considering the price it's a best deal you can get!"
,3,11-Nov-18," am worried about scrach resistance of GORRILLA GLASS 6. ALREADY TWO SCRACHES AT THE TIME OF UNBOXING. NOW I WANT TO RETURN IT BUT, NOT SEEING THE REASONS FOR SCRACHY SCREEN. PLEASE HELP.
IF I TALK ABOUT PERFORMANCE: I WOULD RATE IT 6 OUT OF 5.
CAMERA 4.7 OUT OF 5"
,5,15-Jan-19,"Purchased this on 1st December and got it delivered within 18 hours. So far it has been a nice experience. Don't feel like carrying power backup as the battery life is good and gets fully charged within 1.5 hours. Pictures are great especially with the depth feature. Sounds are good. So until I come across any technical glitch, I am in love with my phone. Can I say that? Maybe little bit..."
,5,05-Nov-18,"The mobile is just awesome in terms of everything. And If u r upgrading from one plus 5t and lower version of mobiles then I would say worth upgrading as I was using One plus 5 previously and this gave me a wonderful satisfaction....
Negative about OP6t is No headphone jack, etither u can use headphones or u can charge the mobile at the same time. And notification light is not there , you will not get to know until u on the screen .....so over all I can say the mobile is worth for money ..."
,4,15-Jan-19,"The software has minor glitches as such the mobile do not respond per command sometimes and is now more frequent. The software has some problem as the screen text becomes big suddenly. One Plus must look into it as the reputation of One Plus 6T may go down if others also face similar problem.

I still think One Plus 3 was performing extremely well than One Plus 6T. I sometimes get a feeling that has One Plus secretly named 'T' as Temporary or Beta Version before the launch of next version say in this case after 6T Launch of 7. Its just a wild guess as had faced Zero issues with One Plus 03 for almost two years since purchase. 6T was purchased brand new from Amazon but its software does not perform well"
,2,23-Dec-18,"I recieved it on 19 Dec 2018... The mobile charger is MISSING in my box, so I requested for refund... Also the battery drains very fast during hotspot is connected, viewing online videos like on hotstar, playing games... And battery takes more than an hour to charge 0-100%... Camera as of now is working good... Speed of the mobile is also good, but is almost same and not that fast of what they are claiming to be... Also, I strongly feel the box and contents in box are unnecessary, like seperate orange outter cover of box, album of hard board, momento, etc. are just to make it more expensive and to pull more money out of our pockets... Instead they could have provided the earphpne in box..."
,5,04-Nov-18,I have been using the device and it's super snappy... The night mode in camera does a decent job since some photos were not as good as the others clicked in the night mode. The onscreen fingerprint sensor is ok. Not as fast as the physical one. Overall it's a superb product. Any who doesn't have OP6 and planning to buy a mobile should definitely consider this one.
,5,14-Nov-18,"Awesome phone with all the features... Camera is best in the class both front and rear. Performance is best compared to one plus 6. The only issue I have is a battery life. Though one plus has increased the battery capacity to 3700 may.. it lasts macimum 6-7 hours of average usage.. if u play games continuously for 4 hours the battery is almost dead. One plus this is not really expected from u guys. The only good things here is when put for charging it charges 100% in abt 45-50 min.
Type c to 3.5 mm convertor works fine. The original sound quality is maintained. Overall a perfect buy"
,5,05-Nov-18,"Okay I'd like to talk about a few things that nobody else is saying. The battery life is excellent for a flagship phone, about 8 hours of SOT which is more than excellent, also the speaker, though single is loud enough for the noisiest of environments. And the people who think that the new fingerprint scanner is too slow, I received a software update as soon I activated the phone, and after I updated the software, fingerprint scanning was a lot snappier.
Overall, great phone in the price range."
,1,17-Dec-18,Everything inside the box is good but box tampered I m confused how does it happen bcos it is sealed in a cover but box tampered
,1,13-Nov-18,OLED whites are washed in low light. Earpiece is a bad design and needs proper ear alligning to hear the sound while on call. The bezeless edges creates accidental touch and phone operations and needs some smart edge touch prevention algorithms. The camera is not that great as hyped. The finger print touch is unreliable. Overall it's not a value for money. Should have been priced at around 25k? and addressing above issues
,5,30-Dec-18,"Review by tech youtuber - Smartphone world YouTube channel
The budget flagship smartphone of 2018.
Love the design, display and battery life. You can get solid 1 day battery life. Good thermal management. Even after long gaming sessions the temp of device is under 40 deg. Headline feature of oneplus 6t is the indisplay fingerprint sensor which works 9 out 10 times. My go to way to unlock the phone. Camera is great but dont expect pixel or apple quality.
Cons:

,4,28-Nov-18,"The Gorilla glass is not at all though . I have scratches here and the in a matter of 1week of normal use and I don't even keep any keys money or whatever sharp in the same pocket as well.
Rest everything seems to be working fine. Even got few updates as well"
,5,25-Nov-18,"6t is rightfully the flagship killer and the best phone in the market today. It has the looks, the hardware and the latest software. Enough pros but it has to have some cons. While it's lesser priced for the specs it contains, 38 grand is still a heavy amount. The camera is great but not the best in the market. Need more color variants in India. The fast charging is an absolute delight."
,5,21-Jan-19,"The best part is they delivered the phone the next day of order without charging me a single penny more. The phone came with a tampered proof bag. Super fast as they say. A little heavy then its counterparts but it gives a longlasting battery life even when on the mobile date the entire time. The camera is super, I like the night mode. Face recognition is amazing and fast."
,5,10-Nov-18,I got defected piece but Amazon has returned it
,5,15-Nov-18,"This is one amazing phone. A must buy.
Value for money.

Amazing battery life.
Screen resolution is just fantastic.
Camera is near perfect.

Only drawback, phone is quite heavy."
,5,04-Jan-19,This phone and it's software is just incredible it is much faster than any Samsung phone I have used and I have used all their models . The screen is not as good as the Samsung but in all other aspects it is as good if not better. best value buy.
,4,07-Dec-18,"Given the marketing hype around OP 6 T and the fact I had used OP 3 for two years with no glitches I naturally expected an excellent product..however after a month of use I would say @42 K OP 6T has lost its magic touch or the 'wow' it achieved with its earlier phones..
I personally experience the battery life has not improved despite the bigger capacity..OP3 gave me better life with similar usage..camera has improved but still not 'flagship' and night capture mode is glitchy..cast option to smart TVs is not supported via prime or Netflix app which worked in older OP devices..phone is a bit heavy for those who like light devices.. Face recognition does not work at night /dark setting unlike a iPhone
Good things about the phone
1.Software remains close to the stock android experience with no bloatware which makes the usage buttery smooth..
2.fingerprint scanner is much better compared to Vivo V11 pro which I found really non responsive
3.screen is quiet good with the notch being the most non intrusive aesthetically designed one I have seen

Guys at OnePlus please don't 'settle' ,expect much more than marketing from you guys.."
,5,10-Mar-19,"It's a great phone and after using it for more than 2 months, I can say I am impressed. It's smooth and fast. All day battery life with dash charge. If you are moderate user it will last you more than 1 day. I usually get 50-60% battery left at the end of the day. Camera performance is also top quality.
Pictures have details and low-light photography is great. Coming from OnePlus 2 it is very nice upgrade. All round device for both work, entertainment and gaming. Perfect for traveling"
,4,19-Dec-18,"OnePlus 6T midnight black,8GB RAM,128GB Storage is a huge flagship killer smartphone that beats so many other phone comparison to the price accordingly, such a smooth phone which never get hang even once after using this for a month ,I am a heavy user like I used to edited photos, videos and etc games I don't try it so far but it's not a problem at all . Camera is superb battery is not bad, performance is awesome video recording is amazing but only problem for me is recording sounds that can't beat iPhone ."
,4,22-Nov-18,"I have been using it for 15 days now. Overall, I am satisfied.

Picture quality : 4.5/5. My friends who have iPhone X, take pictures in my OnePlus 6T.

Sound Quality : The only negative thing in OnePlus 6T. When you play a game or watch a video, you tend to cover the speaker which is at the bottom. Very badly engineered. You block the sound when you play games or watch videos

Battery life : Above average. I wouldn't say it's good. When I turn off Bluetooth, location and others, except Data, it lasts more than a day for me"
,3,14-Dec-18,"Its almost 2 weeks since I am using this phone (8GB RAM + 128 GB ROM) Battery life is good ~3700 mAH but I am really disappointed with the slowness of its finger print sensor. In spite of having 8GB RAM, application's performance reduced after 4GB of RAM exhaustion. It seems that just putting more GB in RAM couldn't make mobile faster. One plus should also work on inter-module compatibility of mobile that means RAM should be efficiently in-sync with processors and its performance.
In nut shell its a good phone but heavy app users who wants 100% performance shouldn't expect muc"
,4,19-Dec-18,"It's not a value for money. Really over priced. Finger touch log in is weak. You have completely over rated and misused your stand in the market to sell this phone.
There were not much expectation but you did not make an endeavour to rise it too. At this amount sound picture and durability has to be good. What was required was to improve the touch and speed."
,5,04-Nov-18,"Another masterpiece from Oneplus... Just loved it the only draw back is the in display fingerprint is a bit slow as we are used only to the external ones, which are damn faster in previous Oneplus phones... Display is crisp but not bright enough when compared to the Oneplus 5t that's due to the Android pie update, the Battery is one of the best till I've used in all my phones. its a beast in its own class .... loving the phone till now"
,5,07-Nov-18,"Picture quality,sound and battery life is awesome"
,2,25-Feb-19,"Buying this phone was an expensive mistake. Despite stellar stats the phone still hangs. The screen just freezes for 30 odd seconds when unlocked. (This happens almost 2 to 3 times in a day) . The battery charges fast, however it also discharges very fast! So unless you always have access to a plug point this will let you down. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack, there is an adapter to connect headphones and this is very inconvenient to carry around all the time. The phone is heavier than the OnePlus6 because of the so called bigger battery (one which discharges very fast). Your money can be spent better elsewhere for sure. Please do consider these points before falling for the tall advertising claims."
,1,19-Feb-19,The phone was listed one of the topper in radiation above approx 1.5 value. Where Samsun g s9+ is lowest ofapprox value of 0.17.af5er investing 37k in this phone I.found this as a silent killer sticking to the user. Now i don't have a choice and I have to use it.Otherwise the phone is quiet good .Day light photos are good but low light photos turns to be not up to mark . Camera application has a bug where you need to switch off and switch on camera for it to sense . This should be fixed in updates.but what about radiation?
,5,15-Feb-19,"Photo clicks are awesome on this phone specially night clicks. Sound quality can be improved, sound is low on this phone. Battery life is good. Overall this phone is awesome with great features. Face unlocks works very well even in darkness."
,5,05-Nov-18,"My last phone was iPhone 6s, and I assumed it would take me a while to get used to the new phone with different Operating system. But it is so amazing and user friendly. I said I love the phone as soon as I started using it. the picture quality is amazing & the voice quality is so much better than iPhone, the speaker is much much better than iPhone and the battery life is the best. In Love with dash Charger. Thank you one plus for making it so affordable and yet so awesome."
,5,09-Nov-18,"After a lot of samsung phones I have shifted in one plus through op3 and after 2 year and 6 month use there isn't a single issue I found in that phone. After a lot drop and marks on body the screen never cracked. Now I am using op6t since 4 days and fully satisfied with best picture quality, look and awesome performance. In one word a complete package and best value for money."
,3,31-Dec-18,Picture quality is looks better as per the mobile cost. Sound quality good. Battery life is worst . You just off WiFi and mobile data and without doing anything on the phone battery percentage gets decreased to 6-8 % which is rediculas. Hope if this gonna fix in next release or version then the one plus brand would be marked higher.
