Bought the iPhone for my boyfriend who had his original phone stolen. All was well, until about two months into it when the screen began to pop up a bit. Went to the apple store to have it checked out - they open it up and see that NONE of the hardware is made in America, or Apple, at all. All products were made in China. As soon as the phone is closed back up, the screen no longer turns on. Apple told me to immediately destroy the phone and get in contact with the seller and Amazon in order to find out the origin and get my money back - I'll be doing just that.",0

"Apple iPhone 6 (4.7 inch - diagonal), 64GB, Verizon Wireless (Silver)",Apple,559.95,5,"I really love this phone ,though it was going t be too big but not really that bad.I had been using 4s and really liked how I could fit it into a fron pocket ,but after waiting too long decided to go with this size iPhone and try it out.Battery life is excellent and the bigger screen is worth carrying around the size.So here s so helpful information (I bought a used one ),the phone is unlocked as a modelA1549 ,no matter if the person who brought it from Verizon leased or bought it out right.That is just how Verizon does it ,there is only one USA model A1549 ,I am not sure if a GSM seller such as t-mobile just deactivated the CDMA capabities or the firmware doesn't have them.So I knew this and bought it to use on T-mobile (actually this is better that a GSM only phone because you can sell it to anyone once you are done with it),the Hotspot feature and WiFi calling both work ,just search wifi calling after you put in your SIM card .Then the first time you use the phone it will ask you to confirm your 911 address ,then you just turn it on and off .Okay now to the great part ,I took a chance on Warehouse deals and it paid off.If you look at a phone for sale by AWD,you will notice just a condition is given (all description as other warehouse deals).The lowest deal ""acceptable ""means this for sure no original box ,no charger and no earbuds.The ""good ""means maybe one of those things is included but not all.The ""very good ""means everything but original box and condition must match (signs of wear but no dents,not many marks or scratches) and like new means just that looks new with everything original.Now if you go for the lowest condition as I did ,you can receive a ""like new looking phone"" with nothing else or a slightly beat up one with scratches on glass.And you can receive any condition in between just no extras.When I ordered the phone ,it stated that it would take a while to get it (AWD doesn't always have the phone ready ,just one matching the description from whoever they bought it from),so basically they uses the lowest ""acceptable "" as a hedge against someone complaining.The phone I got was completely ""like new"" and they threw in a plastic bag with charger and earbuds,and the price was cheaper that any other seller on here by quite a bit also.Take a chance on AWD ,if you are unhappy you can return ,plus they have the best customer service.",1

"Apple iPhone 6 (4.7 inch - diagonal), 64GB, Verizon Wireless (Silver)",Apple,559.95,1,"I received this phone and immediately took it to Apple to have diagnostics run on it. Before they even ran tests, he noticed that the screen has a slight upward bend in it. It's so slight, that I didn't even notice it. However, if I'm going to pay $480 for a phone that is not longer under warranty, I don't want to run the risk of it breaking one month and not being able to return it. After looking up the phone, it says that the previous owner kneeled on it and cracked the screen. At this point, its more worth it to buy a phone on a payment plan through verizon with a warranty, than to risk this. I wish I was able to keep this phone because in the long run its cheaper, but after reading some reviews, I feel like the smarter decision would be to return it.",1

Apple iPhone 6 128GB (AT&T) - Grey,Apple,323,2,"I was going to give it 3 stars, but the text that corresponded with 3 stars was ""It's Okay"". I paused and thought about that for a second, and concluded no. No, it's not okay. The company that Steve Jobs built is self-destructing before my eyes; it' not okay. It was the only tech company that 'got it'. It's the only company that felt like the product was tested with normal people instead of just staff at the company. It's iOS that worries me, not the hardware.First off, the music app was butchered past the point of death. They are pushing Apple Music so hard that it feels like you are in an online store, not an offline app. It's littered with icons that basically cost money to touch. You don't have the option of having icons for songs, artists, albums, playlists, year or any other common-sense field that you may want to see in a music app. A ""Recently Added"" banner takes up half of the screen when you popup the music app in a desperate attempt to make people purchase songs from the store so they can see the banner change. You are unable to search more than 3 results at a time without navigating away from the search page. The list goes on, but I will stop here because one Amazon review won't stop you from worrying about the Music app.It also always prompts you to update your software every day, with no option of turning off these prompts. If it was another company, like HP, that did this, I would take it easy on their software and give this a 4 star review, but because I am witnessing one of my favorite companies (not so slowly) burn themselves to the ground, it's a much more emotional review for me. I knew that Apple would go downhill after Steve passed, but I didn't know the hill would be 90 degrees.",1

Square Trade, always my go to, seems now expensive, has deductibles(99.00) and requires a purchase of a used phone through a carrier that has the phone currently insured or is new.You must contact the seller because clicking on the warranty link takes you to a page that tells you to contact the seller. OK, how? Not readily available. So we must be covered by the warranty of all refurbished items per Amazon-90 days? It would appear that for a few dollars more you can get a refurbished phone from Apple ( this is new since I ordered my phone here) with a one-year warranty (note that is a limited warranty).

Apple iPhone 6 128GB Silver AT&T,Apple,599.95,5,"Bought this after visits to 2 Apple stores revealed that the stores cannot just sell you an iPhone outright (they want payments or a contract or some other undesirable). Such an experience is dumbfounding, indeed! THANK YOU Amazon for saving me from another disappointing visit to what Apple calls a ""store""!! Apple locations are prisons of torture followed by frustration that I cannot spend my money there. I hope to never set foot in one again. Too bad I like their products so much!!",1

I could not distinguish my ""refurbished"" iPhone 6 from ""brand new"" ones my 3 brothers had purchased! (that is no exaggeration) The only difference was that my iphone arrived earlier and was almost $300 cheaper than theirs. I would recommend Ocean Reef Electronics to anyone who is interested in purchasing an iPhone 6 but doesn't want to pay $800-$900 for a ""brand new"" one.",1

Apple iPhone 6 128GB Silver AT&T,Apple,599.95,5,"I am upgrading from an iPhone 5s to this iPhone 6 off contract for the At&t network. I have started to stay 1-2 generations behind because buying new phones outright off contract in the current generation is just too expensive. Overall I am loving the new phone and larger screen size. The seller I got it from sold it as like new, and it fit the description very well. The seller was WBB LLC, and based on this purchase I would recommend them. The phone came with only 1 charge cycle on it! And cost $369.99 without any tax, got lucky even though I am in California and most items on Amazon charge tax in California now. I also bought it with my Prime Store Card and got 5% back, so overall I am please with the deal I got. Especially since this phone runs for $549.99 or higher and tax on top of that. Only thing is I do not have any warranty on the phone, but iPhones tend to have higher quality than android phones and if it does not have any problems the first 30 days, it should last you the life of the device before you want to upgrade. Battery life, screen quality, and speed are all great and slightly faster than the 5s.",0

Apple iPhone 6 128GB Silver AT&T,Apple,599.95,2,"I was going to give it 3 stars, but the text that corresponded with 3 stars was ""It's Okay"". I paused and thought about that for a second, and concluded no. No, it's not okay. The company that Steve Jobs built is self-destructing before my eyes; it' not okay. It was the only tech company that 'got it'. It's the only company that felt like the product was tested with normal people instead of just staff at the company. It's iOS that worries me, not the hardware.First off, the music app was butchered past the point of death. They are pushing Apple Music so hard that it feels like you are in an online store, not an offline app. It's littered with icons that basically cost money to touch. You don't have the option of having icons for songs, artists, albums, playlists, year or any other common-sense field that you may want to see in a music app. A ""Recently Added"" banner takes up half of the screen when you popup the music app in a desperate attempt to make people purchase songs from the store so they can see the banner change. You are unable to search more than 3 results at a time without navigating away from the search page. The list goes on, but I will stop here because one Amazon review won't stop you from worrying about the Music app.It also always prompts you to update your software every day, with no option of turning off these prompts. If it was another company, like HP, that did this, I would take it easy on their software and give this a 4 star review, but because I am witnessing one of my favorite companies (not so slowly) burn themselves to the ground, it's a much more emotional review for me. I knew that Apple would go downhill after Steve passed, but I didn't know the hill would be 90 degrees.",

Prior to purchasing this I had read people having similar experiences, but was hoping I‚Äôd be one of the lucky ones.

My iPhone came with some scratches near the volume button along with near the charging port. Aside from that, my battery was in very poor condition dying whenever it would reach 20%. I did all the troubleshooting suggested thinking it was maybe the software, but the problem continued. I wouldn't waste your money.

The design and features are as good as expected for a company as successful as Apple. However, I was extremely disappointed when, after a few days having the phone, dropped it and the screen shattered to the point where it just didn't work. It wasn't thrown or dropped fromy very high. So, durability is nowhere near where it should be. This was my first iPhone, coming from a long time Samsung user. Needless to say, I went back with Samsung(GS6 edge) and am just disappointed that I wasted the money on the iPhone. Apple can't say I didn't give them a chance, however, back to the practical smart phone for me.",0

"Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone, Gold (Certified Refurbished)",Apple,353,1,"Right from the start this ""certified refurbished"" phone was often unresponsive and frequently froze up. The only way to revive it was to do a hard power-off and reboot it, and even that only worked some of the times. I returned the phone and three weeks later got a replacement, which was even worse: I could not even activate it, as it was frozen from the start. Some on-line research has revealed that this problem is common with the iPhone 6: it is a design problem that has been labeled ""Touch Disease"". Apparently the touch chips on the logic board often partially break off and you get intermittent electrical connections. I'll have to take it to an Apple store and see what they can do about it.",0

"Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone, Gold (Certified Refurbished)",Apple,353,4,"This phone was as described. It had one small scratch on the back. No big deal. We will see if it performs over time. Getting a warranty on this item is difficult through third party sellers. Square Trade, always my go to, seems now expensive, has deductibles(99.00) and requires a purchase of a used phone through a carrier that has the phone currently insured or is new.You must contact the seller because clicking on the warranty link takes you to a page that tells you to contact the seller. OK, how? Not readily available. So we must be covered by the warranty of all refurbished items per Amazon-90 days? It would appear that for a few dollars more you can get a refurbished phone from Apple ( this is new since I ordered my phone here) with a one-year warranty (note that is a limited warranty).

"Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone, Gold (Certified Refurbished)",Apple,353,4,"The phone is great. I have it set up as a tracfone. Getting the Data working was a bit of pain. God bless them, but tracfone support are helpless when it comes to B.Y.O.phone. Turns out that to get the data to work you have to set up the A.P.N and M.M.C.S on an i-phone 6 but i.O.S will not let you manually adjust the settings. The link tracfone provides for setting up this profile Did Not Work, for me at any rate. After a lot of google research I discovered this app that sets it up for you, Unlockit.co.nz it worked like a dream. Now I have phone and data. I already had a tracfone log in so all I had left to do was down load the tracfone app from the app store so I could monitor my available minutes, s.m.s and data.I hope this helps others avoid a lot of frustration. Oh, and straight talk is basically tracfone so this might help those users as well.The phone itself looks brand new as far as I can tell. No scratches or ware and tare of any kind. No ear buds (as expected) but it did come with the wall charger and lighting to USB cable. Call clarity has improved (compared to i-phone 4) and Siri can be useful at times. I have also used the google maps navigation app and it is an adequate replacement for a stand alone GPS.I highly recommend getting some kind of cover/case. You don't really need a screen protector thanks to gorilla glass, but you will regret dropping this phone as the corners will show impacts. It is a slippery little devil, it almost jumps out of your hand like the ""precious"" thing it is.I think the size is just right and the ""reach"" feature is helpful. The only thing that would be better is battery life, and for the love of god let me expand the memory. This is the primary reason it only rates 4 stars.",0

But there were only 2 very small abrasions on the entire phone. The phone runs great and works as a iPhone should. My only regret is that I didn't look at the iPhone SE As I prefer the smaller 4 inch display. It's also faster and has better overall specs than the 6 and it was only $65 more. But if you prefer the larger display then I would recommend this. No problems with my AT&T SIM card, just popped it in before I turned the phone on and it worked just fine.",1
Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,2,"It came with scratches and dents on three of its edges.and the worst part is the so-called refurbished phone did 382 battery cycles!The seller is called ""MyWit""",2
Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,2,It was scratched and Apple emblem was with defects. And the color was nor the same as my new iPad gold.

Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,1,"Disaster. The phone's reception was terrible and it had a short battery life. On top of that, the charger broke after a week with the phone saying that it wasn't a certified charger. The problem with cheap charger is that it kills your battery (or so they say). So, all those suspicious glowing reviews may not be happy after 6 months.Ok, so after all that I return it and, using my tracking number, I see that they received it. Then I waited for a refund, but it never came. I contact them and they said that I have to give them a tracking number in order to get a refund. That was not a part of the return policy. At that point I couldn't find my tracking number so I had to beg my post office for copy. Another waste of 2 hours.The worst part is that this phone isn't even a great deal. I got a new brand model from Boost mobile for the same price. If you want one on the Verizon network, then go with a Groupon deal - again, for the same price. Don't risk a refurbished unless there is a steep discount.Lastly, if you want a free phone, just buy one from these guys and return an empty box. Yes, they are so disorganized that they will give you a refund. I didn't do this, but you certainly can.",2

Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,5,I was hesitant to buy the phone from mywit at first because it was used but it's A+ quality refurbished phone not disappointed one bit,3
Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,5,Works perfectly,
Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,4,"I was concerned about ordering a refurbished phone. But there were only 2 very small abrasions on the entire phone. The phone runs great and works as a iPhone should. My only regret is that I didn't look at the iPhone SE As I prefer the smaller 4 inch display. It's also faster and has better overall specs than the 6 and it was only $65 more. But if you prefer the larger display then I would recommend this. No problems with my AT&T SIM card, just popped it in before I turned the phone on and it worked just fine.",
Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,2,"It came with scratches and dents on three of its edges.and the worst part is the so-called refurbished phone did 382 battery cycles!The seller is called ""MyWit""",2
Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,2,It was scratched and Apple emblem was with defects. And the color was nor the same as my new iPad gold. Also memory 12 Gb instead of 16 GbBut not so bad for the price payed for refurbished phone. And it works well with Uzbekistan network,0
Apple iPhone 6 a1549 16GB Space Gray Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),Apple,379.99,1,"Disaster. The phone's reception was terrible and it had a short battery life. On top of that, the charger broke after a week with the phone saying that it wasn't a certified charger. The problem with cheap charger is that it kills your battery (or so they say). So, all those suspicious glowing reviews may not be happy after 6 months.Ok, so after all that I return it and, using my tracking number, I see that they received it. Then I waited for a refund, but it never came. I contact them and they said that I have to give them a tracking number in order to get a refund. That was not a part of the return policy. At that point I couldn't find my tracking number so I had to beg my post office for copy. Another waste of 2 hours.The worst part is that this phone isn't even a great deal. I got a new brand model from Boost mobile for the same price. If you want one on the Verizon network, then go with a Groupon deal - again, for the same price. Don't risk a refurbished unless there is a steep discount.Lastly, if you want a free phone, just buy one from these guys and return an empty box. Yes, they are so disorganized that they will give you a refund. I didn't do this, but you certainly can.",2

"Apple iPhone 6, Gold, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,119.99,5,"I really love this phone ,though it was going t be too big but not really that bad.I had been using 4s and really liked how I could fit it into a fron pocket ,but after waiting too long decided to go with this size iPhone and try it out.Battery life is excellent and the bigger screen is worth carrying around the size.So here s so helpful information (I bought a used one ),the phone is unlocked as a modelA1549 ,no matter if the person who brought it from Verizon leased or bought it out right.That is just how Verizon does it ,there is only one USA model A1549 ,I am not sure if a GSM seller such as t-mobile just deactivated the CDMA capabities or the firmware doesn't have them.So I knew this and bought it to use on T-mobile (actually this is better that a GSM only phone because you can sell it to anyone once you are done with it),the Hotspot feature and WiFi calling both work ,just search wifi calling after you put in your SIM card .Then the first time you use the phone it will ask you to confirm your 911 address ,then you just turn it on and off .Okay now to the great part ,I took a chance on Warehouse deals and it paid off.If you look at a phone for sale by AWD,you will notice just a condition is given (all description as other warehouse deals).The lowest deal ""acceptable ""means this for sure no original box ,no charger and no earbuds.The ""good ""means maybe one of those things is included but not all.The ""very good ""means everything but original box and condition must match (signs of wear but no dents,not many marks or scratches) and like new means just that looks new with everything original.Now if you go for the lowest condition as I did ,you can receive a ""like new looking phone"" with nothing else or a slightly beat up one with scratches on glass.And you can receive any condition in between just no extras.When I ordered the phone ,it stated that it would take a while to get it (AWD doesn't always have the phone ready ,just one matching the description from whoever they bought it from),so basically they uses the lowest ""acceptable "" as a hedge against someone complaining.The phone I got was completely ""like new"" and they threw in a plastic bag with charger and earbuds,and the price was cheaper that any other seller on here by quite a bit also.Take a chance on AWD ,if you are unhappy you can return ,plus they have the best customer service.",1

"Apple iPhone 6, Gold, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,119.99,1,"I received this phone and immediately took it to Apple to have diagnostics run on it. Before they even ran tests, he noticed that the screen has a slight upward bend in it. It's so slight, that I didn't even notice it. However, if I'm going to pay $480 for a phone that is not longer under warranty, I don't want to run the risk of it breaking one month and not being able to return it. After looking up the phone, it says that the previous owner kneeled on it and cracked the screen. At this point, its more worth it to buy a phone on a payment plan through verizon with a warranty, than to risk this. I wish I was able to keep this phone because in the long run its cheaper, but after reading some reviews, I feel like the smarter decision would be to return it.",1

"Apple iPhone 6, Gold, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,119.99,5,"I previously had the 4s. MAJOR change. Longer screen, slightly wider, skinnier. the sleep button's on the side and the fingerprint sensor is sweet. The home button sounds different when clicked. the vibrate is louder. Reachability is there to help reach things. I like the rounded edge of the screen. It's not that much lighter though. Fast. I wish the screen was a bit wider and less longer though cuz i still have to zoom in to see the words. It's definitely worth an upgrade.",4

I am disappointed that this product was able to pass any seller or professional's quality standards as a properly refurbished product.

"Apple iPhone 6, Silver, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,399,5,"I really love this phone ,though it was going t be too big but not really that bad.I had been using 4s and really liked how I could fit it into a fron pocket ,but after waiting too long decided to go with this size iPhone and try it out.Battery life is excellent and the bigger screen is worth carrying around the size.So here s so helpful information (I bought a used one ),the phone is unlocked as a modelA1549 ,no matter if the person who brought it from Verizon leased or bought it out right.That is just how Verizon does it ,there is only one USA model A1549 ,I am not sure if a GSM seller such as t-mobile just deactivated the CDMA capabities or the firmware doesn't have them.So I knew this and bought it to use on T-mobile (actually this is better that a GSM only phone because you can sell it to anyone once you are done with it),the Hotspot feature and WiFi calling both work ,just search wifi calling after you put in your SIM card .Then the first time you use the phone it will ask you to confirm your 911 address ,then you just turn it on and off .Okay now to the great part ,I took a chance on Warehouse deals and it paid off.If you look at a phone for sale by AWD,you will notice just a condition is given (all description as other warehouse deals).The lowest deal ""acceptable ""means this for sure no original box ,no charger and no earbuds.The ""good ""means maybe one of those things is included but not all.The ""very good ""means everything but original box and condition must match (signs of wear but no dents,not many marks or scratches) and like new means just that looks new with everything original.Now if you go for the lowest condition as I did ,you can receive a ""like new looking phone"" with nothing else or a slightly beat up one with scratches on glass.And you can receive any condition in between just no extras.When I ordered the phone ,it stated that it would take a while to get it (AWD doesn't always have the phone ready ,just one matching the description from whoever they bought it from),so basically they uses the lowest ""acceptable "" as a hedge against someone complaining.The phone I got was completely ""like new"" and they threw in a plastic bag with charger and earbuds,and the price was cheaper that any other seller on here by quite a bit also.Take a chance on AWD ,if you are unhappy you can return ,plus they have the best customer service.",1

"Apple iPhone 6, Silver, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,399,5,My first smart phone was a iphone5 which I loved. This was over 4 years ago and we are up to the iPhone7 now. With that being said I was in the market for a new phone. This phone as of the past 4 days that I have owned it has been great! It has truly been a huge upgrade from what I was use to and could not be happier. The seller was spot on with the description which was nice because I had read a few negative reviews that made me skeptical to purchase this phone being that it is pricy and refurbished. I am glad I decided not to listen to the reviewers and go forward with the purchase so far. This phone had very little scratches and arrived quickly and on the time that was promised. I really hope this review makes it to those that read the bad reviews and lets them know that this was a good experience and that it was worth it.,5

"Apple iPhone 6, Silver, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,399,5,"I really love this phone ,though it was going t be too big but not really that bad.I had been using 4s and really liked how I could fit it into a fron pocket ,but after waiting too long decided to go with this size iPhone and try it out.Battery life is excellent and the bigger screen is worth carrying around the size.So here s so helpful information (I bought a used one ),the phone is unlocked as a modelA1549 ,no matter if the person who brought it from Verizon leased or bought it out right.That is just how Verizon does it ,there is only one USA model A1549 ,I am not sure if a GSM seller such as t-mobile just deactivated the CDMA capabities or the firmware doesn't have them.So I knew this and bought it to use on T-mobile (actually this is better that a GSM only phone because you can sell it to anyone once you are done with it),the Hotspot feature and WiFi calling both work ,just search wifi calling after you put in your SIM card .Then the first time you use the phone it will ask you to confirm your 911 address ,then you just turn it on and off .Okay now to the great part ,I took a chance on Warehouse deals and it paid off.If you look at a phone for sale by AWD,you will notice just a condition is given (all description as other warehouse deals).The lowest deal ""acceptable ""means this for sure no original box ,no charger and no earbuds.The ""good ""means maybe one of those things is included but not all.The ""very good ""means everything but original box and condition must match (signs of wear but no dents,not many marks or scratches) and like new means just that looks new with everything original.Now if you go for the lowest condition as I did ,you can receive a ""like new looking phone"" with nothing else or a slightly beat up one with scratches on glass.And you can receive any condition in between just no extras.When I ordered the phone ,it stated that it would take a while to get it (AWD doesn't always have the phone ready ,just one matching the description from whoever they bought it from),so basically they uses the lowest ""acceptable "" as a hedge against someone complaining.The phone I got was completely ""like new"" and they threw in a plastic bag with charger and earbuds,and the price was cheaper that any other seller on here by quite a bit also.Take a chance on AWD ,if you are unhappy you can return ,plus they have the best customer service.",

It has truly been a huge upgrade from what I was use to and could not be happier. The seller was spot on with the description which was nice because I had read a few negative reviews that made me skeptical to purchase this phone being that it is pricy and refurbished. I am glad I decided not to listen to the reviewers and go forward with the purchase so far. This phone had very little scratches and arrived quickly and on the time that was promised. I really hope this review makes it to those that read the bad reviews and lets them know that this was a good experience and that it was worth it.,5

"Apple iPhone 6, Silver, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,399,1,"I received this phone and immediately took it to Apple to have diagnostics run on it. Before they even ran tests, he noticed that the screen has a slight upward bend in it. It's so slight, that I didn't even notice it. However, if I'm going to pay $480 for a phone that is not longer under warranty, I don't want to run the risk of it breaking one month and not being able to return it. After looking up the phone, it says that the previous owner kneeled on it and cracked the screen. At this point, its more worth it to buy a phone on a payment plan through verizon with a warranty, than to risk this. I wish I was able to keep this phone because in the long run its cheaper, but after reading some reviews, I feel like the smarter decision would be to return it.",

I will have to say I am very happy with my purchase! Nothing has gone wrong yet, and I am hoping to keep it that way! Very pleased! You will too!! GET IT!!! you won't regret it! :)MERRY CHRISTMAS!",0

It has truly been a huge upgrade from what I was use to and could not be happier.

Longer screen, slightly wider, skinnier. the sleep button's on the side and the fingerprint sensor is sweet. The home button sounds different when clicked. the vibrate is louder.

"Apple iPhone 6, Space Gray, 16GB (AT&T)",Apple,345.99,2,"I was going to give it 3 stars, but the text that corresponded with 3 stars was ""It's Okay"". I paused and thought about that for a second, and concluded no. No, it's not okay. The company that Steve Jobs built is self-destructing before my eyes; it' not okay. It was the only tech company that 'got it'. It's the only company that felt like the product was tested with normal people instead of just staff at the company. It's iOS that worries me, not the hardware.First off, the music app was butchered past the point of death. They are pushing Apple Music so hard that it feels like you are in an online store, not an offline app. It's littered with icons that basically cost money to touch. You don't have the option of having icons for songs, artists, albums, playlists, year or any other common-sense field that you may want to see in a music app. A ""Recently Added"" banner takes up half of the screen when you popup the music app in a desperate attempt to make people purchase songs from the store so they can see the banner change. You are unable to search more than 3 results at a time without navigating away from the search page. The list goes on, but I will stop here because one Amazon review won't stop you from worrying about the Music app.It also always prompts you to update your software every day, with no option of turning off these prompts. If it was another company, like HP, that did this, I would take it easy on their software and give this a 4 star review, but because I am witnessing one of my favorite companies (not so slowly) burn themselves to the ground, it's a much more emotional review for me. I knew that Apple would go downhill after Steve passed, but I didn't know the hill would be 90 degrees.",1
