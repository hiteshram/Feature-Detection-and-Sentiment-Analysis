Oneplus 6,4,30-Oct-18,"After a week of using the One Plus 6, I find this phone amazing to use. I won’t go for a spec listing. You can get it from websites.

I preferred to buy this even after knowing 6T was being launched was because 6T has very little upgrades and costs 10k more.

Note to people using high end Samsung phones - You would really hate the display ,compared to Note 8/9 or s8/s9 ,this display is a joke. but overall this phone has great value for money

Originally, I have a One plus 3T. As an upgrade, I went for the Honor 10 on Flipkart. Flipkart, however, made a mess with the delivery. Please read my Flipkart review recently for details. I had to cancel the phone. The next choice after using the One plus 3T was obviously OP6.

One Plus 6 Features

The pleasant surprise for me was definitely the large 19: 9 aspect ratio FHD screen. It’s a 6.28 inches display but still easy to hold and use with one hand mostly. Being a AMOLED display, the colors are very vibrant even in sunlight. I love using it for social media ( Instagram, FB, WhatsApp) since its longer screen can fit in a number of feeds. I also enjoy reading with it. Videos in full view even with the notch are amazing to watch.

The coolest feature in the display is doing away with the physical keys or the software keys. You can use gestures to do these functions and take advantage of a larger full screen.Swiping from bottom to the middle takes you home. Swiping from left or right bottom to the middle takes you back. Swiping from the bottom to the middle and holding gives you recent apps. The problem I face is when using the keyboard very fast while typing. It just goes home sometimes which can be irritating. It’s just getting confused between the typing and the gesture to go home I think. I use the swiftkey keyboard dragging to avoid it but OP must improve this gesture.

The os is very fast thanks to it being very bloatware free and using the Snapdragon 845. There is no lag whatsoever and it is a pleasure using this phone.

Fast charging is awesome on this phone. You are all set even if you charge for half an hour to get to 60% approximately. Very handy in today’s fast-paced life.

Rear cameras @16 mp and 20 mp are quite handy to use featuring portrait and bokeh modes. The front camera also offers decent output @ 16 mp. I loved the addition of slow-motion capture on the primary camera which works well. However, you need bright lighting for it to work well.

Fingerprint and face recognition features are super fast to use. Its small thoughtful things like the option of the screen lighting up in the dark to recognize your face and unlock is what makes this device a compelling one. Speaker is mono and functional to use. Its audio via headphones is amazing, however.

Another welcome addition is true dual VOLTE support. You can have two Jio Sims running in parallel here. This means people calling your Jio number when you’re an idea or Vodafone data connection is active will be able to connect with you. Both Sims can remain on 4g.

For the cash you pay, I think this phone is amazing to own and use every day."
Oneplus 6,1,11-Oct-18,I purchased this phone on 25july and today is 11 Oct...it been less than 3 months and my screen have a dead cell in the lower right corner...even it didn't drop or didn't come in contact of water or any pressure on phone......very poor protection of screen.
,1,08-Oct-18,"the camera is not up to the mark I used one plus two for more than three years now again I bought this six but now I do not want to buy any more this product, some time auto restart by itself. very dis apointed by both amezon as well Oneplus."
,3,15-Nov-18,"I bought it @ 27 k so keeping in mind the price of 27k , I am writing Pros & cons of this oneplus6 :
MY ONEPLUS6 CURRENT OSXYGEN OS 9.0.
PROS :
1. SPEED : YES , AWSEOME YOU GONNA LOVE IT.
2. CHARGER : Its superb , excellent ,mind blowing charge rapidly .
3. SCREEN TOUCH is overall good and buttery.

CONS :
CAMERA : Nice on paper but not on reality , pictures are not crisp sometime have oil paint effect , I think main problem is with image processing. So advise everyone no to update to os. 9.0.2 .

BATTERY BACKUP : It easily last for 1 and half day *if you dont play games as I dont play games. Otherwise for heavy user hardly 3-3.5 hours.

Sound Quality : sometime shrill at full volume.

Camera Bumper : Get scratches , so dont like it.

Now I can say this phone doesnt deserve price tag of 35k , I bought @27k so fine. In oneplus6 , OTA update plays major role beacuse camera qaulity , battery backup and performance as last upadte os.9.0.2 is worst this is the reaon I didnt upadte till now . So always check reviews before updating to latest OTA update."
,3,28-Oct-18,"Worst product and embarrassing customer Care of Amazon.... ""exchange policy of Amazon"" is really a horrible... very bad experience...once they have sold the product they're liable for Post sale service. Amazon sold me defective oneplus 6, 8gb ram, 256 gb, under exchange offer. There technician visited and certified that the mobile is defective. After 2 days exercise they approved the replacement. But there was no update from Amazon about the replacement of mobile. After several Chat sessions, call from team (Everytime cutomar Care person Will ask"" What's the issue sir"", this is embarrassing)...now Amazon changed the color. Now they're unable to replace the mobile and insisting refund. And refund of exchange value of old handset only in Amazon account so customer can't use that money other than Amazon.....really a horrible purchase... Actually I appreciate Amazon but this first experience is totally disturbing for me....still matter is pending and let's see.... end of the episode. You"
,1,12-Sep-18,"Mobile charger is not working properly.
Request you to send new charger"
,1,01-Aug-18,"The camera quantity is very bad.
There is a post related to camera in oneplus community too"
,1,19-Oct-18,"Didn't expected this from Amazon, got a refurbished phone on the price of new phone, battery backup is like about 5-6 hours, picture quality is good but i am not happy with device, phone is getting heated up while normal usage, phone is hanging a lot, i am a big fan of oneplus from long time, using oneplus one from 2014, used oneplus 3t, oneplus 5t, and now oneplus 6, but really not happy with this one, sometimes there is network problem, some times wifi problem, sometimes flash doesn't work, really disappointed with amazon and oneplus. Didn't expected this."
,5,05-Nov-18,"The OnePlus 6 has a 3.5mm Headphone Socket! YAY!

It's a ball-ache. You have so many things to charge up before you can use them... Speakers, smart watch, phone, Go-Pro, toothbrush, laptop, vibrator, tablet, torch, lamp, mosquito killer...

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! I don't want bluetooth earpods that only last for 5 hours between charges and cost upwards of Rs.10,000 and have to be charged up at least twice a day!

Everything about the OnePlus 6 is excellent, and the 3.5mm headphone socket clenched the deal"
,5,24-Sep-18,"Awesome picture quality as now we are getting time to time updates!
Android pie is available now and the phone is working well on it!
Sound quality I would say excellent but it could be extra ordinary.
Battery life is good , quick charging is though available so no battery problem at all ,rest depend on the usage of user!
And yeah the imp. One
New potrait modes are available now in Camera!
Gaming in this phone just marvellous!
4k video recording and slow motion works very well in the phone"
,5,17-Oct-18,"i was bit confused before buying this one plus 6 but during sale i got 1 for my self at a very reasonable cost
for 8gb nd 128 gb variant i must say phone is a real beast it chrges from 30 to 80 in 10 minss
camera is super nd it has a very prenium built quality battery lastss long
in short i must say u will not regret buying this phone its really wrth the cost nd a supr flagship phone"
,1,08-Oct-18,This is misunderstanding to customer because of no any standard for prices
,5,06-Oct-18,"What can we expect in a RS. 35,000 device..??
Everything but not the features of devices of more than Rs. 70,000. But that's not the case with the OnePlus 6. The best phone under 40,000. Camera, best. Display, best. Battery life, freaking epic. Built quality, well you feel it in your hands first(amazingly premium). The best buy in phones because of the features and the price point."
,5,19-Oct-18,"First of all my grievance is that i had ordered it on 10th of August and after 3days seller has shipped this order, may be it is because of sale. But the delivery boy is awesome and nice to talk with he suggested me to open the box in front of him and took video of that also. I have to say that the phone is very premium and nice to hold. Screen quality is just awesome but the battery life is not that great it is not bad but not as expected when you have AMOLED display but the charger that comes in a box is fabulous. Everything is great in this phone considering price. You can purchase this phone blindly."
,1,12-Oct-18,Amazon is selling the defective phone in this sale. The slow motion camera is very bad and dark like a VGA CAMERA. please don't buy 64GB version.
,4,22-Sep-18,"So I eventually but the bullet and on recommendations from my colleagues went ahead and bought the one plus 6

Right from placing the order to receiving it was totally seamless.

Been using the product for a week now and totally thrilled with the overall performance. Serves my purpose as a phone and the battery life is great. The flash charge is great.
Overall a happy customer.....
Keep up the great work Amazon"
,3,18-Oct-18,"Sometimes after using mobile for 20-30 mins and lock, it is not unlocking using finger automatically, I have to press power button and unlock it again. Most of the time auto brightness is not working. Tried to replace phone, and it is redirected to customer care. Once communicated to customer support, they promised that they will call me next day with some solution. Now it is 3rd day, no call and no mail regarding the issue raised. Tomorrow is last day for return. Bad experience after shopping during big billion days..."
,2,03-Nov-18,"Overall this is one of best phone which I used , great photo and video quality, above average low light photo quality, bright display , long battery life and the most important things is very good performance (never seen any slowness issue)
Now the second part, I am not sure it is only bug in my phone but I am facing a pathetic call voice issue It drops voice call and sometimes difficult to understand what others are saying I intially thought it is network issue but when I compared to my other phone ( Sony Xperia XZ Premium) it was very clear in same. I contacted Amazon but as return window is closed I need to run behind service centers Very disappointed as need to repair my brand new phone now Amazon should change retun policy at least for expansive phone. In future better i will avoid these Chinese brand , Sony and other similar reputed brands are always better in quality as they do thorough testing at least basic features."
,5,14-Oct-18,"I have had been wanting to purchase oneplus phone for a while, had diviated after oneplus 2, but then, notch came, of which i wasn't a big fan of, waited for 6t, realised notch still there, and jack is being removed, happily took oneplus 6. It's pretty much an exceptionally good phone with a display, I mostly get mesmerised by, the duality of photo and video is pretty much as per my expectations, I'd love some more control over slow motion and timelapse though, but maybe after an update?
I've hit it with every heavy hd game I could find, and it worked happily, once after the initial loading, pubg loads in less than 10 seconds! Oh, and my antutu benchmark came as 2,90,000 or so :3 I'd say, if you're not interested in not having a jack port, and If you don't really care much about inbuilt finger print, you can go for this, though, perhaps 6t might have the new apeture settings which samsung has brought out, meh."
,5,23-Oct-18,"Check the photos I snapped using Oneplus 6 and you can judge it by yourself. Nowadays having depth in photos is very much trending, but the awesome thing which I personally like is the detailing of light the camera captured, never expected such awesome results. it can certainly compete with DSLRs in terms of composition. Apart from this very fast in focusing and capturing the image, that sunrise image I captured on moving vehicle, it's simply awesome.
Few other things which I find it unique and you won't find it any reviews are;
1. Text messages are automatically sorted in the inbox and it's easy to maintain important messages and notification SMS properly organized.
2. I have multiple Gmail accounts for official use and each account have multiple contacts stored in it, so after adding all those Gmail accounts in the phone it is only syncing contacts from my primary Gmail account and therefore my phone book contacts are not getting messed up.
3. Gesture control is awesome, it gives freedom to use the phone as per our ease and one can also customize it on different levels.
4. Network and internet speed is too good.
and I am sure there is much more in this phone as I will go exploring.
Apart from this, phone looks are pretty awesome and rich. It gives a premium feel and the phone is very much noticeable.
I am not a gamer so for me, battery is lasting almost 24 hours with frequent usage of fb, whatsapp, gmail, insta, google, skype and of course phone calls.
The only thing missing is an earphone, I think the company should provide that too, otherwise, phone comes with case cover and pre-installed screen protector.
Overall, you won't regret buying this phone. if you are landing in the range of 20-25k, then push a little bit and go for this phone it will be a paisa vasool for you.
I hope this review will be helpful. Good Luck."
,5,19-Oct-18,"Well, you know that feeling of awesomeness, when you get more than what you expect, this is what it is for me with this fantastic device.
Brief background: I've been the most loyal Iphone customer- bought each and every iphone device till 6S when it got launched and in the process spent a lot of money imagining I am 'investing' in the best. I loved iphone for their robustness and simplicity (yawn), and style (really).

This time around, I compared various devices: Iphone X, S9, Huawei phones and OnePlus 6 and wanted to break through my loyalty by buying a non apple product. It wasn't a simple choice to switch your loyalty, so has to be really an upswing to convince me.
I tested most of the products and ended up buying OnePlus 6. Below is the summary of Considerations, expectations and outcome after 2 weeks of using the device. I will compare it to my iphone 6S as that was my going out model.

1. Speed: I need good speed- as I do multiple things, apps, bookings, payments, excel sheets, ppt presentations, all thru the phone. I m not a gamer but probably use up more bandwidth and compute than what gamers do.
My iphone tired me no end and I believe the lack of compatability will make my iphone x experience similar if not worse.
Oneplus simply blew me away- blazing speed, accuracy, I don't make spelling mistakes when I write ( somehow I feel the keyboard is arranged suberbly well- Iphone was a disaster for me). The phone solved multiple small things for me- taking long screenshots, faster operations. I somehow feel, that my internet speed (dumber), is faster on Oneplus than Iphone.
2. Build: I wanted a phone just like iphone that's robust and strong. One Plus 6 is much better, sturdier and the touch-feel is superb.
3. Charging/Battery: Biggest concern with Iphone was the battery life and it still is for most apple devices. Oneplus is blazing fast charging with dashcharger, holds charge for atleast 1 day for me with extreme usage of the device. ( I use my phone for professional usage) v/s an Iphone 6s which would not even last me with 2.5 hrs of charge.
The charging cable is very robust, the charge connector all- are pretty high grade.
4. Photos/Pictures/Scan: My iphone 6S wasn't bad and I've seen Iphone X which is good but I wanted REAL like feel- finished and touched up a bit to give a ready to serve picture. Oneplus 6 exceeds my requirements here. Pics of my newborn daughter come out very neat and deep. The depth feature (probably using the 2nd camera) is amazing and the pictures does show her hair over the face, dimples and smirks.. basically if you are able to see the emotions thru the portrait - that defines the pic more than the mega pixels.
5. Size: Obviously the size is much better than iphone 6S whilst any other device could match it. Though the screen clarity and videos through my prime video are flawless - better than tv lcd.

4. Price: an obvious one- is super attractive for the device. With loads of features and high build grade, It definitely will make apple run for the money.

The only aspect that I miss are original oneplus earphones that should come with the device to make it a well packaged device to use.

Overall I think, I made a superb choice with this device. To me, if an Iphone X and OP 6 come within the same price range for similar specs, I would definitely still choose OP for it's speed, built and quality.

Wishing OP all the best. Please connect if you need any more details on phone usage or unique features or use ca"
,5,21-Feb-19,"For sure the best smartphone I ever owned - no schnickschnack but pure power, works ultrafast, great screen (even though I would like to have it a little bigger), regularly updated Android, never any issues with whatever apps, and the battery brings me over the day (mostly). Camera for most purposes ok (but I have my Sony Cam which I use still for videos and most of my still pictures), scans documents fine (using clearscan app) and works quite good for fast pictures in between. Has meanwhile even a great night mode.
Use the device with two LTE sims (Airtel and Jio), both work fine.
Charges ultrafast using the original charger as well as on my quickcharge powerbanks (from Mi) when I use the original cable. Fast data transfer to my laptop as well.
So I'm totally happy, nothing what I would ever miss here. Well, besides the display could be little bit bigger ... ;-)"
,3,17-Oct-18,"I had purchased midnight black and my device is handheld by myself only but after few days i saw that color from volume key is getting removed even while my product is being protacted by cover from the 1st day itself and 2nd reason was after spending more money didnt got any free screen replacement option.phone is good to use,smooth
camera 3.5*
Screen quality 4*
Speaker volume 2.5* they could have added dual speakers or increased the volume level.
Vibration sensitivity 2.5*
earphones volume clarity 4*
Software 4*
Charging 5*"
,4,18-Oct-18,"So i am writing this review after using the device for 1 week on Android pie (9.0):
Pros:
1) The amoled screen on this device is best in the class offers great viewing angles with deep black.
2) Battery on this device is just awesome i am getting over 6+hrs sot every time with gaming around an hour.
3) Speaker output is good considering single bottom firing speaker.
4) Camera on this device is good,takes some good day and night time photos.
5) Dash charge is awesome charges the phone completely in 70min.
6) Got this in awesome deal from amazon.

Now cons:
1) Output via 3.5mm headphone jack is bad ,i tried different earphones ranging from 2k to 12k but believe me audio is worst part of this device.
2) Glass back is a finger print magnet so use it with the supplied case in the box.
3) Bokeh effect/depth effect is a hit or miss from both cameras."
,4,23-Oct-18,"Good mob with 8 Gb Ram. Value for money high end mob. Looks stunning with Corning glass 5 & red looks.Great speed. Downside:SMSs can't be locked from inadvertent delete, can't move files by select & move but has cut & then go & past in new folder.Not as user friendly as Samsung. Samsung software is way ahead but Ram less of Samsung. Doesn't have SdCard slot which is huge negative point as vital data can't be copied for posterity & incase mob goes bad which Chinese mobs including Oneplus are quite notorious.Last 3 mob of One plus in my family went usesless after 2 to 2.5 yrs with total loss of data.Contacts are visible throughout & can't be hidden. There is no speed dial lkie Samsung. Overall decent mob."
,4,18-Oct-18,"Does it really need a review. Nevertheless here you go
Awesome camera quality
Amazing performance whether it's gaming or day-to-day usage you will never feel any lag or whatsoever.
Battery life is though good but not the best as compared to Zenfone 5Z which has same battery capacity
Build is amazing and you will feel it when you hold it. Although you will have to be extra careful while using with or without a case. Glass body
Speaker's are average again as compared to Zenfone 5z.
Call quality is excellent no network issues.
Super fast charging...
Both front and rear ?? is simply awesome
Clear and crisp pics even in low light. Video quality is also v nice
Value for Money ...Go for it or wait for 6T"
,4,15-Oct-18,"Jst like a normal android phone.you may find a littile amount of changes in this phone like picture quality display quality.camera quality is good and in output speaker sound quality is avarage but u find a decent amount of sound effects in headphone.
One thing i could not understand that After updating my one plus 6 to android pie issues regarding brightness problem and youtube fullscreen problem happened . before that update i usually put my phone's brightness to 20% but now i get that same kind of brightness on 70%.. what kind of problem is that.. not cool from oneplus.. it would be nice form you to find a way to fix it"
,5,15-Oct-18,"Just switched from the Poco F1 to the OnePlus 6. Both phones are excellent, but the OnePlus 6 is slightly better imo. This review intends to solely compare the OP6 to the Poco F1.

Poco F1 -
Pros-
1. Price - Unbeatable price!
2. Battery - The 4000 MAH battery of the Poco is an absolute delight. It lasted me 1 1/2 days of moderate to heavy usage, as compared to 1 day with the OnePlus 6.
3. IR face unlock - the face unlock on the Poco is better than the OP6 imo. It works in pitch dark settings and is faster. (Note: OP6 face unlock is also very very good, don't get me wrong!)
4. Speakers - The stereo-like speakers on the Poco trump the OP6's below average speakers.
5. Liquid cooling - I haven't tested the OP6 with heavy gaming so can't comment for the OP6, shall update after doing so. However, heavy gaming on the Poco is a joy, no heating whatsoever.

OnePlus 6- apart from the above features, the OnePlus 6 beats the Poco F1 hands down.
Pros-
1. Screen - AMOLED, much natural Colors and darker blacks.
2. Oxygen OS - much better than MiUI, cleaner with faster updates. Already have 9.0 Pie on my OnePlus 6, still waiting for the Poco update. Also, the gestures and other features on Oxygen OS are incredible.
3. Camera - again, haven't tested the OP6 camera heavily, so shall update when I do so. This one's a really close call. I really liked the Poco camera, but from my initial impressions, the OP6 just beats it.
4. Dash Charge - absolutely insane speed! Much better than the Poco quick charger.
5. Water resistance - although there is no official IP rating for the OnePlus, YouTube videos and reviews prove otherwise. The OP6 is as good as water resistant. The Poco, on the other hand, is not even splash proof.
6. Looks - the OnePlus is a much better phone in terms of looks and feel. I also love the alert slider on the OnePlus 6.
7. Price - Got the OnePlus 6 for a great price in the great Indian sale! For the sale price, I would blindly go with the OnePlus 6 over the Poco F1.

Performance - tie. Same processors, same results! Both are blazing fast. They breeze through anything you throw at them.

Conclusion - both are great phones, but if you manage to get your hands on a OP6 during the Amazon sale, I would go ahead and buy the OnePlus over the Poco without thinking twice!"
,1,11-Dec-18,"I bought this phone just 4 months back on Emi considering the best option in current phones, and was using it very well, and then suddenly 2 days back my phone felt into bucket filled with water, and as per committed by one plus 6 team, going with the thought that it is waterproof, i switched it on and boom the phone went off completely, when i showed it to nearest service centre they said as the water has lodged in to the ic the phone is not working and they asked me to change the Screen (Inr 10000) and Motherboard INR (22000) - Total Cost 32000, in this amount you could buy a new phone,and the denied considering any warranty for the phone as this was a case of Liquid spill... i really dont know how this service centre works, they did not even register my complaint and just told me nothing can be done.. cant imagine i just burned out 35000 in just a span of 4 months on this phone, also when the phone back cover was opned it seems to be a used one..
"
,5,30-Oct-18,"Screen quality is pretty amazing. Performance wise there are no lags observed even with multiple apps open in background.
Sound quality is average.
Camera quality is just superb. Portrait mode works pretty well with the edges in decent lighting conditions but I observed some smoothening happening in a bit low light conditions.
Selfies are also pretty amazing.
4k videos provide the real feel of the moments and 720p with 480fps capability is really good.
Battery life can support for just over one day with normal usage. Thanks to dash charging for charging from 10% to full in 45-50 mins."
,1,01-Nov-18,"One plus phone : 5+ star
Amazon customer service : Null Pointer Exception

I bought One Plus 6 on 9th October and got it delivered on 11th October. I tried to register for Free Damage Protection (servify / 811 kotak bank).
But I couldn't register as kotak bank was not providing offer and it was still showing on Amazon website.I dropped mail to Amazon, one plus and kotak bank and also discussed this matter with their customer service agents.
Most amazing reply was from Amazon . Amazon representative told that although they are promoting false promise but as the offer is provided by kotak bank , amazon will not take any responsibility.
Again amazon providing same offer for one plus 6t and they changed registration process this time.
I want to ask amazon if they are following good practice as they are not providing the services that they have promoted during their biggest festival sale."
,3,06-Oct-18,"processor is very good
speaker is not as good
video and audio recording quality is not good
cameras are normal
battery life is very good
looks are too good
amoled screen is also good
face unlock and fingerprint sensors are too fast"
,5,16-Feb-19,"This is a gorgeous phone with top-end specs, a good dual-camera and a lovely OLED display.
It bit more pricier than previous entries in the series,
but considering what you get that’s something we’ll take.

What OnePlus has done is nailed all the most important stuff and made a phone that offers excellent design,
specs and performance at a frankly ridiculous price. So for most people, the 6 is an absolute bargain.

Pros
A huge leap in design
Seriously fast
Dash Charge is still great, if slightly restrictive
A well-thought-out version of Android with great extras

Cons
Camera still needs improvement
Missing a few ‘flagship’ features"
,5,08-Oct-18,"Premium smart phone experience, with a higher midrange price. 8 gb RAM, Very good camera quality. Oxygen OS is very much fluid. Near about stock android experience, with little bit extra functionalities. Superior SD845 chip provides butter Smoot mobile experience. Responsive face ID, though it doesn't works in dark environment. It's touch response little bit slow. It has single audio speker. No wireless charging. Though the back of the phone made of glass. Screen quality is very good. Overall an very good product with a decent price point."
,2,01-Oct-18,"Phone is Good But We are facing Many Issues With Calls Especially Incomming Calls, Most Of The Incomming Calls are Noty Recived , Many People Said Me that the phone is going Switch Off and Not Reachable , Kindly Tell Us How and Where to get it Fixed Or Return It and Give Us a Replacement , We Have Tried Sim Card in My Old Note 8 To test Sim And is is working Absolutely Fine."
,1,08-Dec-18,"After using two months,a software updating was done.since then,calling number ,contact details are not coming when an incoming call comes,only ringtone is coming.unanle to answer any calls.All the way outs as suggested by customer care persons executed but problem remains same,After purchasing for nearly rs.43k,this problem makes me to worry a lot.who is there to say the solution.customer Carr's response is not satisfator"
,5,06-Mar-19,"Just one word for One plus, Wow!!!

I got for 25k during the sale. Thanks Amazon for giving all the offers during that period.

Things I liked:
1) Picture quality/Camera/Screen when it's ON,
everything on the screen is crystal clear.
2) Sound quality
3) Sleek design
4) Quality of the back case which came with box
5) Fast charging
6) Processor: super fast with no lag at all.

The only thing which I don't like in this phone is it's battery life. On heavy use I have to charge it twice a day but that's fine for me atleast.

It was delivered the very next day with good packaging."
,4,16-Oct-18,"It worth for money.
1. The quality of the picture in day time or light vision was so good. But the picture during night mode or low light, it's not good.
2. The front camera was good enough during both mode. Sound was good. Battery life stays for a day, if both internet options WiFi and mobile data is enabled. The battery life could have been better.
3. The back cover comes with box fits perfectly which makes us statisfy. All the 4 Conners were well designed. Its quiet difficult to hold as size is big, but it's good for movies.
4. Processor is designed well which maintains the fast and not like any another product which gets slow down after few days.
5. Headset is missing, but not a big deal. We can choose suitable one from market per requirement. Inbuilt radio option is missing which is quiet disappointment
Phone heats quiet and battery stays for a day.
Feeling little difficult to use Android as new OS and using Apple products previously"
,1,22-Nov-18,"I have used Samsung, apple, Nokia, MI till now at least two years. this is the first time i feel i should get rid of this phone at the earliest. unfortunately i bought this phone one month back and made factory reset and OS installation in service center twice because of so many issues. worst experience, i am surprised to see such a hype for this device. heating issue, battery drains fast, few apps do not work, second sim doesnt work sometime, dual app doesnt work, hangs and behaves weird sometimes.. not reliable at all. i paid very high price for this quality. i have never experienced such bad experience with Sumsung and Apple so far. Oneplus has a long way to reach their standards."
,3,06-Nov-18,"Phone has been upgraded to Android 9.0. Very aggressive battery and RAM management. Most aggressive I have experienced so far. And yet battery barely lasts for one day and average RAM usage is around 4GB on a regular basis. I don't play any games on mobile what so ever. No specific apps for social media like Facebook Twitter etc. Everything is handled on browser, that too very sparingly. Stand by battery consumption is poorer than my previous phone i.e Moto z play. This phone was blazing fast I must say but that too for only first few days. Now face unlock has slowed down considerably.
Not happy with RAM and battery management at all. I used to run activity tracking app on my Moto whole day without any problem. But oneplus just kills them in the background. Can't track activity on Apps like Pacer, Strava etc. I don't see what's the point of having 8 gigs of RAM if the phone needs to kill apps. And even then ironically avg RAM usage is 4gigs without any games, browser, social media apps, music or video running.
There is AMOLED screen but no always on feature. No extra ordinary screen resolution. Yet battery life is pretty much ordinary. One plus could have made the device a bit cheaper with LCD screen instead of AMOLED at least. For the premium of AMOLED over LCD I am only getting better contrast ratio and that too not par with the samsungs and apples.
Audio output of speaker is heavy on trebble side and lower frequencies appear to be muted gradually. 3.5 mm jack output is average with 16 ohms earphones. And with such battery performance never thought of connecting high impedance headphones.
On rear 20MP camera is pretty much useless for photos. It's just there for claiming that the phone has dual camera setup. Google has already shown that everything can be done with only one camera. And of course notch means there is no front flash.
Can't customize the slider button used to switch between silent vibrate and ring modes. That's pretty much fixed. I would have preferred I could turn on do not disturb with that button.
If not for assured software updates and little bit of water resistance, I would have opted poco f1. Built quality doesn't matter when you are going to keep the phone, which has glass on both front and back, inside a protective case.
The heat sink appers to be on the frame so phone gets really hot while performing tasks like navigation video calls etc if you keep it inside the case provided in the pack with phone."
,3,20-Oct-18,"Picture Quality is Good about not the best, I believe Selfie Camera could have been better ..
Pro Camera Mode , still lacks with feature ...
Sound is good, Oneplus6T has stereo speakers it seems.
Multiple Bluetooth Speaker connectivity is not there, OnePlus did not have update yet..!
Battery life is average.
Speed is wonderful, Snapdragon does it part.

Oneplus 6 is a really nice phone,I love it..!
Happy with the purchase..!"
,4,28-Oct-18,"My review is based on my thoughts and my experience which I never found on the internet while searching about this smartphone.
I would speak about an experience of people like me for whom this smartphone is the first flagship killer they ever bought.
1. This phone is damn fast and we all know that. So we never get to experience anything like a lag. A whole new experience for anyone for the ones who are planning to change their phone from budget to a mid-range flagship.
2. One shouldn't define it as flagship. It's not a flagship. It's a flagship killer which means you will have a flagship like experience on a smartphone which looks or feels like a budget smartphone when held in hand. It doesn't feel like using a true flagship device. note: If you have 10k extra go for the LG G7+ ThinQ. It is a complete package and a true flagship...!! Also, Pixel 2 XL is available at 40k during festival offers so you can have a look at it too.
3. My major questions when I was confused in between buying Oneplus 6 or LG G7+ ThinQ was
(i) which camera was better! Oneplus 6 or Lg G7+ ThinQ...?? The answer is LG G7 is better except for Oneplus has an edge over better video taking technology and better selfies.
(ii) Which screen feels better for the eye...?? The screen quality on LG G7+ ThinQ feels a lot better than Oneplus 6 despite G7 being an IPS display and Oneplus 6 an Optic AMOLED.
4. The audio quality is the biggest silent drawback of Oneplus 6. In other words, I never enjoyed while playing a song through my headphones.
Overall, I would definitely suggest buying a Oneplus smartphone to anyone for its amazing software, its speed, and performance for the given price"
,5,08-Sep-18,"Hello everyone,
This is d best product I ever used.
Forget I phone & other costlier phones .
This is d perfect package & worth of money.
Heads off to Amazon , got delivery in 2 days as they committed.
One plus 6 is ahead of every other device w.r.t performance. Best camera , best resolution , best memory management , ND u get d best gaming experience , only it has one lacking point that it doesn't have good sound range as it has only one speaker , hope they will improve this in next variant.
But over all completely satisfied with this"
,2,19-Oct-18,"thisi s my review after using 3 days.phone is good.camera quality is good in daylight and ok in low light.
face unlock is bad,even it open for others after failing with tap and swiping the screen.
battery life is ok not too good.one day max with minimum utilization.I could see there is 5% drop from night (10pm ) to morning 6am when it is in night mode on.I am facing only incoming call drops(not in network area).I switched to my old phone & had no issue.
Lodged a complaint with oneplus,they said it is network issue,raised a complaint with airtel.waiting for feedback from them"
,3,03-Mar-19,"This phone has amazing size.
This phone is better value for money than apple and pixel for the money they are charging.
The only reason why i gave 3 star rating is.
The apps / games sometimes don't support this phones ratio.
Just try playing angry birds and Banana kong . This is a really surprising issue which has not been fixed by One Plus.
If you want to play PUBG then that's another case . This issue affects old games which doesn't scale or detect and scale properly which latest games like PUBG can.
Having said not expected from phone costing 35k."
,4,28-Jan-19,"Performance is good, but has some issues. The mobile Internet on the phone stops working and required a restart almost 3 times a day.

The people at the sales outlet at Seawoods Grand Central Mall are not even willing to talk to you. They ask you to go to the service centre. They say that they don't know technical stuff, only information for selling. They perhaps are worried about customers getting influenced by the visit of a customer who has run into problems. Instead of reassuring the customer, they keep repeating - 'Go to the Service Centre. We don't know anything.'. This is is so so sad.

The people at the service centre say that it required a factory reset as there is some OS Corruption. This is strange. Additionally, they do not even have an option to help you with your data backup.

The only good thing they had at the service centre was good coffee. The place is worth a visit only if you want some good coffee. Service is not their forte. Thank you."
,4,07-Oct-18,It works great and is very snappy due to its animation but after a week of usage a slight problem was developed in the vibration motor which inspite of being in warranty was not repaired by the service center. Aside from this I do get an above average battery life which lasts full day with moderate usage whereas with heavy usage the device has to be charged for the second time in the evening. Camera is not exceptional but it’s good for the price.
,4,12-Oct-18,"After deciding among many android phones, i decided to buy One Plus 6 and it was a good decision. Phone has a crisp display and comes with lot of processing power. Loved the front camera, takes sharp pictures. Rear camera is also great however pictures may get blurry when subject is in slight motion. Looking for a good camera app that can help fix this.

Overall a great phone at this price point."
,5,12-Oct-18,"I moved from redmi note 3 to this phone while thinking I might miss so many features of miui but to my surprise, the oxygen is has almost all the miui features in a more elegant way. Used it for 2 days,I am not a heavy user so easily got 1 day battery life( camera sucks lot of battery though).camera is very good in this price range(front camera is ok ok and edge detection inportrait mode is not perfectly done).Audio experience is not the best but it was louder than my previous phone.Dash charging with type c cable is insanely fast. Already got the Android p update. Call quality is very good. The display is unbelievably good(AMOLED display, gorilla glass 5 on front and back), especially for a budget phone user like me.There are many gestures related to navigation buttons, there is ambient display feature (lift to wake), screen can be calibrated to default/sRGB/DCI-P3/Adaptive mode/ custom color(warm and cool slider), supports double tap to lock and wake up, gestures to open apps, supports parallel apps, 2 4g Sims can be used simultaneously,there is nfc, gaming mode, reading mode, night mode, face unlock, finger print scanner( both can be used simultaneously and both are extremely fast) notch can be hidden, there is customisable LED notification,app lock, otg support, FM radio, sound recorder, no default music player, 3.5mm headphone jack :-), no bloatwares except for 1 OnePlus community app and Google apps, not a big fan of gaming, so haven't tried that....and the list goes on. And of course timely android updates."
,4,23-Oct-18,"I'm a pro smartphone user. I judge every aspect for the review.

Pros-
1. Dash charge is amazing. 1hr 10 mints hardly and full charge. Battery 1 day on normal usage.
2. Beautiful display. AmoLed really is superb.
3. Daylight or artificial light, you won't complain the camera.
4. Beautiful design, no doubt premium.
5. OxygenOS is like liquid.
6. Snapdragon 845 really boosts your internet speed.
7. Never lags in any game.
8. Ah those gestures. I love that.
9. Who complained about speaker, I don't feel it is low. It is good infact.
10. That notch! Pause.

Cons-
1. Very fragile. You have to keep it very carefully. Has tendency to slip.
2. Don't rely on Gorilla glass 5, it breaks. I've seen it. Probably the back glass will break first.
3. OxygenOS is great. I don't understand why it hangs sometimes. I need to lock screen and then turn it on to be workable. Maybe unstable Andriod Pie. Most hanged app - FB messenger
4. A bit large screen. You can't use it by one hand, provided you got medium sized hands.
5. Camera has issues in low light. Still better than Poco or Zenfone.
6. Selfie has some problem in artifical lights. The background is taken in low pixels. So, if someone is standing behind, he will not be as clear as other at front.
7. Woaah, the fingerprints it catches. Massive bro!
8. Water resistant huh? Really? Should give an IP rating.
9. Fingerprint is fast, no doubt. But sometimes, I have to tap twice or thrice over sensor to unlock.
10. I donno what security they uses for face unlock. It is lightning fast and even unlocks when not looking at it. Face unlock is weak security wise.

Give it a like if it serves your purpose."
,1,06-Nov-18,"Am an early supporter of Oneplus since 2014 & always being satisfied with the phones though price has kept moving up.
This particular set was received at a very attractive price (considering oneplus One imported from US on invite) but did not load few Apps, server errors coming for some other just after opening and using it for the first time.
Amazon techinical team advised to load diagnostic app wich also failed to download. Dont know why this has happened.

Phone has been taken back by Amazon and had a worrid time with that!! Lost some opportunity on offers also due to return."
,4,12-Oct-18,"Ok, OnePlus surely knows how to turn heads. pic quality is amazing but there are a few tiny things that prevented me from giving a full star rating.
1. Face unlock happens only after pressing a button.This should not be the case.
2. Real colours aren't displayed, the camera is auto tuned to give the high contrast. While this maybe good for a certain set of users.I didn't like it that much.
3. Speaker sound seems too loud and overall they can work a little more on fine tuning the sound. Its ok when you put in headphones though.

Rest everything, Loved It! Got it in Amazon sale so that was great too"
,2,04-Nov-18,"Face unlock doesn't work many times. This is no longer the budget phone it used to be. Now a days oneplus is spending heavily on marketing too. There are phones with better performance to cost ratio these days like poco etc. They are not innovative and late in most tech and hardware but they proclaim everything they give offer is break through. They were late in everything e.g. in display fingerprint, dual camera etc. They hype everything which most phones have it already so not longer quality and budget phone. They are just trying to create Fan base which is eventually back to other budget phones with better innovative,quality and price."
,5,14-Jan-19,"Pros
1. Exteremley fast user interface and navigation. No hanging, heating up while using multiple apps.
2. Quick updates from OnePlus. (Pie, Security patches etc)
3. Camera very good. However for night photos one might want to use Google Camera app with Nightsight. Video recording is decent as well in bright light.
4. All heavy games such as Pubg, Asphalt 9 run in high resolution.
5. Sound quality is good but struggles a bit for loudness especially if you have high impedance Earphones.

Cons:
1. No memory card slot
2. No stereo speakers
3. No IP certified for water resistance
4. Battery life is ok. Though charging is fast."
,4,07-Nov-18,"I bought this phone in July and its about to be 4 months now it is working perfectly. After upgrading to Android Pie, one glitch is there i.e. fingerprint sensor doesn't respond in once when phone is left untouched for a longer time. Rest all is good. Nightscape mode is also there in the latest update. Sound is good. Battery is also good but could have more like 6T. Earlier before Pie, optimisation was too high as most of the apps didn't run in background unless they are opened and kept open in Background (Outlook, Goibibo, MMT, etc) but now that is resolved. Satisfied with the phone overall. But if possible in next update remove that fingerprint issue also."
,2,26-Oct-18,"Hi RocketKommerce,

I bought this product on 29th of August and I have been using this for the last 2 months. I am facing too many problems with this system as its getting hang sometimes when incoming calls, and I am unable to answer to the calls. Also, It's getting stagnant while I connect my headphones.

When it comes to its camera, I have some major problems while recording the video in a good room light conditions (the pixels of the video is getting confined). Slow motion video out is getting flickering in close shots and several others problems. I am sort of tired using this over-hyped mobile device and I really want to return this phone to Amazon and apply for the refund as I believe Amazon and Rocket Kommerce show their credibility to respond to this and act wisely.

Thanks and looking forward to your reply."
,2,13-Oct-18,"It have a 6gb ram but it running slowly after using one month of period apps also taking time to open.
One month back I buyed this one now I want to return this product Amazon is not selling good products and not giving at least one month of return policy wast"
,4,14-Oct-18,"It's Amazing!!! Best phone at a decent price. This is first 30k range mobile I am buying and I am in love with it.
I bought this during Diwali sale and paid 24.5k with exchange, cash back and discount.
Interface, camera quality, battery and overall performance is just wow!"
,4,09-Sep-18,"Pros
-Performance beast!!
-Battery charging like a champ..
-Battery backup also very good
-screen quality is good, best1080p screen available at the market
Cons
-Heating when playing heavy games.
-speaker accidentally covered by hands
- camera quality avg. ...
-always put a shock absorber back cover otherwise cracking your phone at the first attempt ,as easy as droping a glass piece"
,5,07-Nov-18,"Really liked the phone. It is everything it claims to be. High end hardware for a medium price range (when compared with iPhone). Battery is good, no heavy draining. 1 hour charging keeps my phone alive till next morning. Iam not a heavy gamer or always screen-on type of user. I use my phone in my breaks and mostly after reaching home. Hardware is still running good after incremental updates. I really really like the face unlock which even doesn't let you see the lock screen. Amazingly fast. Midnight black is really good with all the glass on its back it feels like a high premium quality mobile like around 80k. Best buy in the price range and also a little above its price range."
,2,29-Jan-19,This is my honest review of one plus 6 and i am not even faking it please its your money i don't have to anything with it i just wanna let u know guys these devices performs best as compared to flagship phones but i am having a very bad experience after 3 months of usage.I use to play pubg on this phone but now i can see fadded icons of games like shooting button sertings button names health etc even if the game is closed i tried updating rebooting but the problems are still there and now i am planning to go to customer service of one plus.I will post the honest opinion after visiting to the customer service.
,5,26-Oct-18,"It fulfill my utmost requirements which I expect with a smart phone. Phone is really too fact, unbelievable Face scanner, Work on VOLTE which connecting call & data really too fast, Camera pictures Quality also good, deep detailing observed. 3300 Mh batter but do not have any problem as discharging rate is very slow and charging with Desk Charger is very very Fast, only require 60 Minuts to 100 % Charging. Overall Satisfy our need"

,5,09-Dec-18,"Bought this one just before the relase of the 6t, so had a very good deal. Got the 256 GB variant for ?35.5k which was very sweet.
If you ask why go for the 6 when the 6t was just a week away. I'ld say that the internals are exactly the same. So there is no upgradation on the performance stand point. The cameras are exactly the same, you do have a headphone jack which is my personal preference and also I prefer the normal fingerprint sensor that is on the back instead of the optical under the screen. The screen on the 6t is bigger by 0.1"" so that's not like a huge difference. On the notch front i'ld have preferred the tear drop shape but basically can't complain when you get such a good deal.
So decided to buy this one and got a super super super sweet deal at Amazon. Delivery was fast.
The device that we order in India is the one that's assembled in India at the Oppo Factory."
,1,23-Oct-18,"Got a faulty mobile I guess as camera automatically going shutting down time to time when try to take capture.
Sim network issue faced in slot 1 however sim is working fine in slot 2.
Battery backup is also not even full day if you go on a drive and it is must to carry dash charger. One my friend told me this is the cause due to pie updation and soon it will be resolved, hope so.
I talk to amazon and customer care representative scheduled a inspection for after three days. It is really wondering. Replace process is also full of frustrating."
,5,21-Oct-18,"Really nice phone for the price. The quality is really amazing. Great to have an out of the box guard. The dash charger is amazing. I was initially pessimistic about the battery backup due to its on-paper capacity, but the practical backup coupled with the dash charging is literally the best. The camera is really precise. I'm not an expert but it's gives really sharp pictures, has lots of options and doesn't get heat up even after extended long periods of video shooting and casual gaming. The speaker is also great(it would be better if they weren't mono speakers though) . Honestly speaking, I moved up from Moto g4 plus to this device so everything feels much superior but it's definitely value for money"
,4,08-Nov-18,"Based on my experience so far:
Pros
1. Speed - there's simply no match for it, you can open any number of apps simultaneously and it won't crash with 8 gigs of ram and Snapdragon 845 processor.
2. Display - looks good and the phone looks like a premium handset.
3. Price - got it at 35k (at a discount of 5k) when the last few pieces were available. Considering that 6T with minor upgrade for battery is priced at 42k (8 GB + 128 GB), this is value for money.
4. It's got a 3.5 mm jack - absent in 6T. Say what you want - 3.5 mm jack is currently a must for sound quality with good headphones and convenience (consider the inconvenience of carrying a USB C adaptor etc.)
5. Good battery life - should easily get you thru the day even after heavy usage. Charging is also quick with the dash charge technology.

Cons:-
1. Sound quality on mono bottom firing speaker and earpiece is not on par with stereo speakers of my previous budget handset - Moto G4 plus.
2. No SD card - but this is compensated adequately if you have 128 gigs of internal storage
3. It's a glass back - need to handle delicately - can't imagine dropping it even with a back silicon cover."
,1,21-Jan-19,"dont buy this phone ...... today(21/01/19) while charging the mobile i saw small flame from charging point of phone. Instantly i removed the charger and saw that charging cable & mobile charge point got burnt. it may also have resulted bursting if i was not present. purchased from amazon on 12/09/18.
most interesting is that customer care of one plus six not entertaining me."
,4,19-Nov-18,First time using One+ product. I had availed Dusshera offer and mobile delivered on time by Amazon. Thanks for it. Everything was good except Battery as it was draining fast. Sleeping time was not set initially. I did the same and battery draining time has reduced. I have contacted Amazon and they had offered the service of a home Service Expert. He had come and suggested a couple of other setting changes as well which has increased the battery usage time. Now I am getting a whole day with heavy usage. Camera is just awesome. No over heating issue. Fast charger is an additional advantage. When the battery problem had started i was bit repentant that I should have waited for 1+6T. Now I am fine as battery is giving reasonable coverage throughout the day.
,3,12-Oct-18,"I received my phone today(12/10/2018) on sale.
After receiving the phone everything seems quite good from outside so I ran some test through OnePlus care app then my test for speaker failed,I got scared as I just received a brand new phone,for once I thought may be it's refurbished phone they send me after all it's sales days.
Then I looking up for solution at internet and found some creepy solution like restart,boot the device but all in vain,then after all this I clear the cache memory and factory reset my phone after doing that it finally works.
Still doubting the originality of phone(fresh or refurbished?)
"
,1,06-Nov-18,"In this price range, this is not a worthy product. As per my experience after 03 months only it has lot of problem.
1. It is stop showing notification of message on screen.
2. Incoming voice quality is also decreased always had noise problems while talking.
3. For early 01 month ?? life was good but now it is also decreasing.
4. Company is promoting high speed but I didn't find anything special from any 10k worth phone.
5. I purchase this phone for camera quality but as such there is no specific features of camera.
I suggest instead of going this costly product better go for any low rates Samsung phone."
,3,20-Nov-18,"Everything is good about this phone, except that the good features that were there in Moto G4 are missing. I'm not talking about the brand specific features. I'm more worried about the options and settings that were available there.
1. Now There is no option to independently setup notifications per app in lock screen when phone is locked and pull down tab when phone is unlocked. In summary, lock screen is cluttered with notifications from preferred apps, while there no space for music apps for control. I gave feedback about it, but there is no response from OnePlus

2. The apps list is now tiled vertically side by side with no option available to set it like one on top of the other, like it was before. The navigation with earlier approach was very fast. Now it takes longer time to navigate through app one by one

3. Volume control is not good. It takes you to whole new page. Any video playing at that time would stop. This happens especially when I am playing video and want to turn off alarm sound or reduce ringing volume.

4. Bluetooth does not connect to already known device automatically. It it seems to take long time.

5. The gestures are not sensitive enough to work first time. It needs at least two attempts to open app through gestures on locked screen"
,4,02-Nov-18,"Camera quality is NOT good at all. By seeing unboxing vidoes and reading reviews I had a impression that camera should be good, but since I am using and realised camera is not at all good. Pics don't have clarity. Night photos sucks, it's better not to take photos at all during night times because it is an embracing movement while showing to others ??
Slow video is the worst feature because no clarity at all.
Sound is not amazing but ok ok. Because one need to keep increasing and decreasing volume to hear properly.
If Bluetooth earpods are connected then battery dies very fast compared to other phones like Samsung and Moto.
Good thing is RED back looks very premium and beautiful."
,1,09-Feb-19,"Hi, am facing many issues with the product I received. Phone gets blank screen smtimes, apps get closed suddenly, battery running out fast, getting noise vibrations for incoming calls etc. I want to either exchange or get this repaired under your service as it is having 1 year warranty breach on Amazon. Now am not even feeling this mobile to be a worth of 5k mobile because of the defects I mentioned. Kindly, respond and exchange my mobile. OnePlus support team told me to get in touch with Amazon only. So, you need to do the needful."
,5,17-Oct-18,"Device is awesome with zero lag. Picture quality is at its best. Reading mode is awesome for Kindle app, News paper apps etc. Battery lasts for a day at least with 3-4 hours of display usage and all time 4G on. Overall device is good.
If the cost get reduced by 3k-5k, it's THE BEST value for money smartphone.
PS: Mine is 6GB, 64GB device. I would've loved it if it had been 6GB, 128GB configuration. As I and most of the people I've known who have bought it are not high end users, and the device lacks extra memory slot, OnePlus can consider this feedback in future.
"
,1,19-Oct-18,"phone is good,but very bad video quality in video calling option from native video calling screen
(that means dial number and make video call) really very bad quality
for this reason i changed sim to again my samsung S8
except that phone is good"
,1,19-Nov-18,"Picture quality is good, sound is also good. But what the use if battery drains like anything. I have to charge 4 times in a day with normal usage. Just a hype waste of money. No customer care, no support. All money wasted. Highly disappointed. I am not playing games on phone, just occasional usage of FB and calls. Even camera is not much usaed. For first few days phone battery performed well. Now it is a pain."
,5,23-Sep-18,"My experience with this 8 GB - 128 GB phone bought last month is it is an excellent phone and value for money. I also use Apple 8 as an alternate phone, but this scores higher in terms of options / facilities provided, speed and storage apart from the versatility of latest android. It charges very fast, has good security features, facility to lock apps for privacy etc.
For all those looking for a top-end phone in the range of 30,000 plus, this is a good option."
,3,04-Nov-18,"Oneplus 6 performs smooth and has decent battery life. Charging speed is one of the fastest out there. Audio via head phone jack sounds really compressed and muddy i'm completely dissappointed with it's performance. Speaker sounds okay and gets reasonably loud. The camera takes some decent pictures but the images look overly processed and has aggressive noise reduction which reduces the detail and sharpness of the pictures. Video recording is good with good stabilisation and the 480 fps slow motion video mode is fun to use but it needs a bit of work as it drops quite a lot of frames and makes the video look jittery even with ample lighting. The display is really good with excellent colours and offers good saturation levels and makes the colours pop. The software is very minimalistic, snappy, fluid and easy to use. The call quality,signal reception and wifi performance are also very good. But now with phones like lg g7 thinq being available at a lower price than the oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t and oneplus ditching the headphone jack for the 6t make it hard to recommend these phones as that lg phone has ip rating, better qhd display, wireless charging and quad dac for better audio performance and a wide angle camera which is rather useful than the useless 20 mp camera of the oneplus 6 and 6t. Overall oneplus 6 is a good phone but not the best in its price range as it used to be from the oneplus 3 to the oneplus 5t. Even the oneplus 6t is also being priced close to 40000 which makes oneplus lose the customers who made the company. Even they are gradually increasing the prices and the features doesn't justify the price increase."
,1,15-Nov-18,"Despite the phone being good,the service is extremely poor. The charger stoped working after 25 days exactly. When i complained on amazon,they clearly shunned away from taking any responsibility and the oneplus customer care service asked me to visit their workshop which is like 200 kms aways from my place. So before you buy this product,make sure you live near to chandigarh,ludhiana or amritsar if in punjab.
All their easy service or warranty claims are false."
,5,28-Oct-18,"This phone is really a masterpiece when it comes to speed and display quality. The screen is superb with excellent details. Sound quality is exactly what we like and what we want. The slider to change the mode to vibrate and silent is cool. Although the battery is good enough, but a heavy user might get a little disappointed with battery. My expectations with camera quality was also not met. The photo quality is good but when we zoom in, it does get blurry which I believe should not happen."
,5,25-Oct-18,"the one plus 6 128gb is best phone and it comes with a back cover also.......although there is no one plus earphone or headphone with it that the company should have provided..........otherwise its one of the best phone ,maybe equal to iphone or better than that as its price is within reach...... the camera is incredible ,both rear and selfie.......portrait mode is like pics from dslr.......!!!!!! the phone comes with latest android version and is best to use for heavy gaming app!!!!"
,5,06-Jan-19,"I have never used such a smooth and responsive phone in my life.
I have played a lot of games on it. The latest one I am playing is PUBG mobile. After playing for one hour still the phone works butter smooth. No hangs, no lags and no restarts. Overall I am totally satisfied with the product. I would recommend everyone to buy this pho"
,3,16-Oct-18,"Photos quality good.
Battery backup is not improved from oneplus5.
Notoch is not better..
Sound quality in speaker is very loud and not preferable option to play music.
Headphone sound quality is good.
Dash charging is good
Overal not good as compared with 40k"
,5,21-Aug-18,"Pros: Amazingly fast, superb hardware, excellent OS, perfect camera, gestures are too good, premium looks specially red variant.
Cons: Much improvement needed in sound system, it may be done in some OS updates. Battery life is good but can be better, however charging is really fast.

Overall it is worth the buy. Every penny is worth it."
,5,18-Oct-18,"Bought this for my dad who was using Samsung S5 previously & was really frustrated with its battery backup and tendency to hang. I was skeptical about shifting him to this brand as he is very choosy about brands. But finally went for it after reading and viewing 100s of reviews and honestly after about 15 days of usage this hasn't disappointed on any front.
Its ultra smooth, superb picture quality, no problem with sound output, beautiful build and display even outdoors, long lasting battery etc. It is more then worth for this money. Even now I am planning to shift from samsung note 3 to next flagship of one plus"
,4,12-Oct-18,"Well being a Samsung S6 edge user for 3 years I was sceptical about the brand initially . But once i got the mobile in hand I knew one thing for sure , this mobile is a beast , the display is pretty good ofcourse not good as Samsung , the camera is pretty good for the price , ofcourse it cant match Google's Pixel or the S9
But where this phone blows everyone away is in its performance , ots sinply the fastest android out there . And the Dash Charging is amazing fast.
Only grouse is the kinda meh Battery life
But overall an amazing phone"
,5,15-Oct-18,Thanks Amazon for giving op6 for 27k. This makes it a great deal considering how refined the product feels. Got Android p update soon as the phone has been set up. This phone has very few shortcomings and it feels very premium. Highlight of this phone is definitely oxygen os. This is a very good rom with many interesting touches. Overall a very refined product
,4,17-Oct-18,"Picture quality is very good and sound is also awesome and battery is avrag.
Head of one plus there are one big problems I was found in camera in slow motion feature recording in the night time it's continuely blinking that's why video was record clearly so take it seriously and please fix it's problems as soon as possible"
,4,31-Oct-18,"Took away one star because Amazon delivered it in a filthy plastic cover with some bubble wrap. Not even a box for a high price item.
Product Review:
1. Camera is very good...but not the best in low light (not expecting better low light photos from a phone)
2. Call reception is good. Loud and clear sound wen playing music. But no stereo effect. I love that part in my iPhone 7.
3. Display is excellent.
4. Battery life is excellent. The best part is it’s dash charger. Charges to 100% in about an hour.
5. Glass back is beautiful but one has to be really careful in handling it. Better use a cover. I use the one which came along with it free. (Takes always the charm though)
6. Speed is awesome. Fingerprint scanner and face unlocking is fast & superb"
,3,27-Jan-19,"I'll be completely honest, the product is good but not something that blew me off my feet. Face recognition and finger print ID are quite fast but not perfect. Camera is good but videos below full HD seem to be of lower quality than they should be. Slow me video is patchy and bokeh is below average. As a new device battery life is average. I used to have a Nexus 5 and despite the ""huge"" upgrade I don't see a huge performance boost. This device even crashed several times while playing simple games. Sound quality however is one of the best any loud speaker, even if not the loudest available, is still good."
,5,25-Oct-18,"The phone is phenomenal. The overall performance of the is great but at times the phones's response is a little slow or gets stuck, otherwise no issues. The camera quality is amazing, the speaker is probably the best of the phones that I've used so for. Their OS I feel, if its fine tuned will probably be the best of the phones in the market"
,4,10-Dec-18,"After 3 months of use, i find this phone really worth it. It just need some software optimisations.

Camera- The image quality with the stock camera app is decent. However, the Gcam mod has done wonders which can be installed without root.

Speakers- People say that it's sound is tinny, but in my opinion, they perform pretty good and can handle loud background noise easily.

OxygenOS- The best thing of this phone. The light and bloatfree ui has made me fall in love with the software.

Battery- It was really a beast when the phone was on oreo. Whereas, in pie, it has degraded a bit but it can easily cut through the day with 2 charges (while playing heavy games like PUBG in my case).

Performance- No words. It handles everything you throw at it easily.

Looks- Gorgeous

Screen- It's a massive screen. Some people may find it difficult to handle but i think due to it's tall form factor and thin bezel design, it's not difficult to hold on. Moreover, the screen quality is really nice.

The last and the best. Dash charger. It can charge upto 65% in just half an hour.

I totally recommend this phone to everyone."
,5,22-Nov-18,"Indeed best phone available in this range. I used to use notice g phone previously I though Moto g has got the best better lyf. But even this phone has got good bettery lyf. Picture quality is good. Very quick charging, phone will run whole day even if you play games. It has got the speed too. High quality photo and videos results in takes Ng more memory. Very user frandly phone."
,4,29-Sep-18,The phone is great .. no complaints .. excellent graphics amazing camera and descent battery life .. my problem is with the charger as the input is 220-240 volts .. almost all chargera of all phones are 100-240 volts .. so when I travel abroad I have to take another phone or buy another charger .. that is just lame...
,1,12-Dec-18,"Its been a month, i have buy one plus 6, It rear glass got cracked up, due to its got heat up. Its very grief to say such issue i am facing from one plus phone. I tried to contact amazon customer support, but unable to reach. Kindly provide the service as its not my fault."
,4,26-Sep-18,"Two cons:
1 major - average battery life. If you are a youtube user, you will need to top it up in the evening.
1 minor - camera could be better. Admittedly this is not a. 60k flagship, but 40k is a lot of money and they need to do better to justify this price tag.

Display, performance, software UI are all amazing and beyond reproach."
,1,24-Oct-18,"Anytime stop responding then have to wait for 10 min for auto response. Voice getting raise anytime in between while playing music or video.
Amazon customer care also helpless to do anything on it. Raised 1 complaint with them to replace it due to some 3rd party app is not working on this device"
,4,10-Nov-18,I've been using this device since a month has been completed now and I am completely impressed by the quality of performance and software usability and Optimisation as well as the camera quality is just perfect for the price we are paying for this phone only issue which we have is not just with this phone but every phone with this snapdragon 845 like poco F1 is the normal battery life and I hope in future update it might be fixed with a update .continious usage without gaming gives full day battery life but if i do gaming and normal usage together then battery life is lasting for just half of the day but overall it's a great phone with great specifications thank you oneplus.
,1,11-Oct-18,Battery life of the product delivered is poor. It has drained more than 30% in 3 hrs . Phone gets heated up while talking . This is the first day of usage. Definitely not expected of One Plus
,5,14-Nov-18,"This is the last one with 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone's performance is amazing. The battery gets charged really quickly. Imo the fingerprint reader at the back seems more convenient than in the front although face unlock work perfectly. A small negative would be the position of the camera. If I do not put a cover on the phone, the camera touches the table and may get scratches over time."

,5,27-Nov-18,Best phone at this price. Camera quality is awesome volume is ok. Little problem in volume slide button sometimes it shows ring and media volume but sometimes only media volume. So have to volume it up to go to the settings. Hope the new update will solve this problem. Otherwise classy device at this price
,4,24-Sep-18,Its a great phone given the price.i am pretty much satisfied with the battery and the display. Also has got a nice display. Fast charging is also pretty good. Phone is very snappy with snapdragon 845. Camera is not at par with pixel and iphone but given the price range u won't regret it. Face unlock is the fastest we have in the market. Fingerprint unlock is also very snappy. The only downside is the speaker that is very tiny.
,1,03-Feb-19,"Once your cell phone is damaged within the same year, neither amazon nor OnePlus is gonna take care of you. In a country like India where 35,000 is a salary for middle class person for a month It's nothing for oneplus or amazon either. I purchased in OnePlus6 in May 21st and then it's screen was crushed by a motor bike on road (where it fell accidently). I went for taking support to OnePlus customer support where the person said straight no on my face to replace the screen.

OnePlus 6 is one of the amazing cell phones I've ever used but it's customer support especially for a premium cell like this is heart breaking. Whole return and replacement strategy is not customer robust or friendly.

After this incident, I'll never recommend anyone to use OnePlus until the person is capable of handling 10K of expense just on changing screen that too within the year of purchase."
,1,25-Nov-18,"I'm disappointed with Amazon as they for the second time they delivered it late. Their transportation service is messed up. The delivery guy was rude and acted like he did me a favour. He wasn't ready to accept my phone which cleared a test on Amazon app. The call centre guy had no info about the results.

Now let's talk about the phone. Over all it's a good phone but it defeats the purpose of a cell phone. It has design flaw. The call receiving speaker is so tiny that you can forget about using this phone for calling. Rest all is good."
,4,24-Sep-18,"The brightness control is pathetic.... 1 to 4 % it gives likes half of brightness of phone.... And from 50 to 100% the brightness is almost the same.
Since there is no music player of its own.... It makes the experience for normal life boring becquse players from playstore are not what you want if you love hall effects.
Except these everything is perfect and yeah the face scanner unlocks the phones even if you are not looking at it"
,4,16-Oct-18,"Both the phone 2 weeks back , had a battery issue but solved it with data saver and now battery is solid hard and last more than a day with proper usage of around 6 hour 35 min screen on time, wow I must say .. coming to camera I find it great as 19:9 take a vivd photos but 4:3 lacks the vivid output , might be with software .. video is great over all 8/10 as I came from iPhone 8 plus and Samsung Galaxy S8 but still gives a great output . Hardware is great and software is smooth"
,5,12-Oct-18,"In my opinion this One plus 6 The Best I used so far , regarding camera super I must said video quality is excellent, battery is good, performance excellent, sounds not bad but couldn't compare to the iPhone sound quality I must said because I have use iPhone se and the sound recording is so good , otherwise I love this phone 1+6 it is recommended to everyone.
Go for it guys."
,3,18-Sep-18,Not like advertisement shows the mobile and camera very poor quality on night or low light shoot as the price tag must be go samsung not Chinese mobile not premium as samsung. So think twice before why this mobile because is build quality not premium as the price tag.
,4,24-Sep-18,"Its great phone , fast , fluid and easy for day to day work , speaker sound is on the slower side otherwise rest is ok. Apart from the phone the cashback which has been mentioned while purchasing has not been credited by amazon . Because it has been mentioned that for a particular bank debit or credit card no promo code is required and yet no refund yet . Hope its not a gimmick to just show this offer on purchase while check out"
,5,26-Oct-18,"it has been 3 months now i have been using this product and everything is just wow. All the updates are made available easily , happy and satisfied with the product . one thing I noticed that after Android p update , Selfies are seemed to be washed out a bit ... 4.5/5 .... 0.5 deducted because of the price"
,4,13-Sep-18,"Excellent performance truly awesome fastest charging, battery of 4000 mah and wireless charging should have been included with Better sound output from speaker."
,4,29-Sep-18,"ound quality was not up to mark..and also capture is very poor while capturing moving persons and objectives.
Earlier I used to capture same like with my iPhone 5s , that was very good quality.. I was not satisfied with this phone while using Music players, camera, etc.."
,5,09-Nov-18,"The phone offers a lot for the price. Since you are here, you would already know the pros of the phone. The downside of the phone that you need to keep in mind while making the purchase is about the speaker. The single firing speaker on the bottom is below par. Also, though the phone is very slim I felt it is a bit heavy."
,4,19-Oct-18,"Battery life is not satisfactory.. otherwise it's a good device to have . Using for last one week , only thing that is not matching with my expectations at all is battery life . < 15 hours without any games or movie/ video ."
,3,19-Sep-18,"Dear One plus
I bought this fantastic oneplu6 all side are good bt battery has a problem..
battery draining/ discharge so quickly... in a day I have to charging 2 or 3 times.. for save to battery to discharge i dont play any game and dont watch any video and other... what to do... will have to use this phone like this....
I give you 5 star bt i have a issue so i give u 3 star ... plz fix this issue.."
,2,13-Oct-18,I was a proud one plus 2 user. But I am not getting the speed and performance as I expected from my new phone one plus 6. A premium phone as it's moto was speed. Using WiFi or 4G not getting the rapidness some times. And Once a heart breaking shock like I switched on my Bluetooth to connect with a Bluetooth speker and that made my phone to switch off unexpectedly.
,4,16-Oct-18,"Very responsive, voice assistant is too good, good quality camera. I think the phone is very stable.

Only compliant is : the back panel made of glass is too delicate. My phone which is just (5 days old) has fallen from 2 feet and the back glass broke (despite being covered in a case)

I think they should go with a metal back or toughened glass."
,5,05-Dec-18,I have purchased this for My Father-in-law and He is Enjoying it to the fullest. He rarely use all the features but What is most important for Him is Operating Speed and Camera. And The Phone is monster in the speed. Works Fast and The Camera Result is Outstanding.
,5,21-Oct-18,"What can I say? I love my phone. The camera, speakers, battery life all excellent. Dash charger top notch.
Only issue I have is with the OS is the unability to move pictures in the gallery between folders. I need to connect the phone to my PC to be able to do that. If OP can fix that, I'd love it."
,5,16-Nov-18,"At this price point, this is an unbeatable phone. There is very little to fault here. Amazing OS, very fast processing, ample memory and storage, a brilliant camera, excellent display, latest android 9, great community support. The only downside is the single speaker but that does little to take away from the overall experience"
,5,23-Oct-18,"It works well in most areas and with all apps. I find it so good I hardly have to pick up my other devices to see pages on the Internet. The only limitation is outside the range of broadband coverage the phone struggles. If you are on Wi-Fi at home, in the office, this is the best device to have. If you are moving around, I don't know how good it is."
,2,15-Dec-18,Camera quality is so bad. I have stopped doing video call with this phone. Just because I could not return it back it within the return periin have to face the consequences of it. Very bad canera quality. Will never suggest anyone to buy one plus phones.
,5,12-Jan-18,"I AM A FAN OF ONE PLUS.I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE.GOT AT VERY COMPETITIVE PRICE DURING GREAT INDIAN SALE OF AMAZONE.PICTURE QUALITY,SOUND QUALITY AND BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT CONSIDERING MY EXTENSIVE USE.IT IS KING AMOUNG ALL ANDROID DEVICES."
,4,11-Nov-18,"I was using iPhone for the last six years , spending more than 1 Lac on phone does not make any sense. Finally, made decision to switch to android. I have used Xiaomi also, it also has good phones but Lacks in camera quality. Both Poco F1 and OnePlus 6 are good phones. Using both phones for more than a month and satisfied with both the phones, however touch of OnePlus 6 is slightly better than Poco F1 but front camera of Poco F1 is better. Overall both are good phones but build quality, touch and back camera of oneplus 6 is superior. As of now no regret on switching to android. Since iOS is more secure , so analyzing the security aspects of android."
,5,16-Oct-18,"One plus 6 is buttery smooth performance with SD845. , dont buy 6T version as it does not have headphone jack , it means you have to purchase only one plus accesories only and you can not attach other accesories also charging a wireless headphone is headache. So guys go for One plus 6 o"
,5,28-Dec-18,"Anything you throw at this phone, it will handle like a breeze whether it's the high quality graphics demanding games or high RAM requiring apps. No lag, no stutter ever. Added to this is the awesome Sony camera in the rear, clicks some breathtaking pictures. Charges from 0 to 100% within 50 mins"
,5,13-Oct-18,"Excellent performance. The phone is butter smooth. Apps open very fast and despite opening multiple apps,there is no lag. Camera does very good job in low light. Games are very smooth and it's a pleasure to use the mobile. The UI is also very simple and smooth. No unnecessary bloatware. Only thing I that could have been better is the speakers and output sound. Phone charges from 0-100% in roughly 1 hour which is impressive. Battery life is okay. Lasts a day on moderate usage. OnePlus 6 is a hit. Must buy !!"
,1,10-Oct-18,"Worst Battery Life
Below Average picture quality
Average Sound Quality
I made a big mistake by buying this mobile phone."
,5,20-Sep-18,"Thus, OnePlus has made a kind of ""Android iPhone"" which i mean the Android phone with no lags, hanging and even more speed.. OnePlus community fans might expect lot more in the future models i hope they never disappoint us.. 5/5 for this now! With Great Battery Backup it charges within 1:15mins and discharges very slowly that's what slow thing this phone has"
,4,22-Oct-18,"Picture quality and sound quality is very good. Look is also awesome. When you purchase this one, you will not think of other mobile. Dash charging one of the plus point. But battery life is not that much good, gets drain quickly. One plus should work on this more to sustain in the market with this price range. Overall experience is good."
,4,22-Jan-19,"Overall it is a good phone, I am new to Oneplus and felt very much satisfied. Camera is awesome and I never felt any lag in any functionality or app. Only problem is battery, if i use camera for clicking pictures it gets discharge in 4-5 hrs. I am not even talking about videos. Even at normal usases battery will last for hardly 7-8 hrs."
,5,30-Aug-18,"This is the best smartphone one can have, whether it is camera,RAM performance,dash charging,etc each n everything is awesome.But still their is one issue i.e. battery backup for heavy usage is not so good if you are not an heavy user then battery backup is quiet satisfactory.Being an heavy user,I have to chargey phone twice a day.
But I must say well done ONEPLUS."
,4,31-Oct-18,"As i am ISO iphone user, for first time i bought android and tat also oneplus 6, picture is good it should have been better than what its taking as its specification tat the company written, battery works nice and the sound quality is also great, so over all its a great phone among other androids but remember always tat iphone is always the best..."
,1,04-Nov-18,"Phone is getting hanged many times and battery backup is very poor. Neither I play game nor I use phone much. Not sure why my phone battery is dying so soon. I may got the defective piece of oneplus 6.
Overall performance is OK like other smart phone. Nothing to feel great about Oneplus."
,1,17-Oct-18,"Well I m a regularly user of one plus I had purchased earlier one plus 3 t but me facing problem with the phone
Whenever I get a call it doesn't get displayed on the screen it just rings
It's too difficult to identify who is calling
Secondly it is giving problem while switching on the mobile once it's switched off request assistance plz"
,1,01-Sep-18,Battery is draining too fast.....can I get a replacement
,4,21-Oct-18,"The phone is absolutely excellent. But my bad luck, Had big scratch on the screen. apparently it comes with a pre applied screen protector The Amazon customer care is not aware of this fact which led to a lot of hassle. I cross checked with OnePlus customer care and local authorised centre for this and kept the product.
Lesson learnt: amazon customer is not fully aware of the product specs and be very careful before you make a purchase.
Kudos to OnePlus team for a great phone"
,5,06-Nov-18,"Unhappy with my previous phone, I wanted a device which was gaming compatible, battery efficient, has a fast processor and offcourse enough space. After a lot of evaluation I purchased One Plus 6. Although, it was one of those instances when I was shelling premium but then I am extremely happy with my decision to purchase the product and the efficient delivery. Highly recommended"
,5,22-Nov-18,"One of the best phone. Awesom camera with excellent still pics, excellent videos with slowmotion. Only one speaker is present good quality with nice sound clarity.. Battery life is good but not the best.. But the dash charger awesome, charges from 0% to 100% in hour.. Overall best quality and also got it for a best deal.."
,4,16-Oct-18,"Bought this beauty in Amazon sale. Got the best deal but had to hassle with the delivery system.
No complains about the product. Best phone of current time. But, delivery system made me reduce one star in the review. Delivery dates were changed, getting extended without any justifiable reason. Had to call customer care 5 times to get the product on time."
,5,11-Dec-18,One of the basic function in a phone is messaging (sms).Everytime while starting the application it gets stuck.Everytime i receive a msg or try to text something the app gets stuck and it takes a good 5 to 6 seconds to work properly.I just don't understand why nowadays the software developers donot give proper attention to the basic features of a mobile phone.I have more than one phone of oneplus and very satisfied with the products but this text message application problem is present in the devices.
,3,18-Oct-18,Updating android pie some of bugs are fixed like headphone jack quality and sound quality are good now but sum of application are not performing well like lots of time my facebook messenger crushed also feeling some lag on pubg. Rear camera qwality are awesome but front camera below avrage. Also feeling display brightness issue after updating on pie. Please fix it.
,5,06-Jan-19,"Superb, steady performance, great speed, excellent camera, and a very sturdy and reliable build. For all the specs, this beats any and every other much-higher-priced brands of cell phones. Just buy it! Love the red colour too."
,3,20-Jun-18,phone is too costly and no earphones available. At least should get good deal on earphones for one plus user
,5,05-Jan-19,"Performance is too good, display is awesome, I am using it for last 3 months but never ever hanged, battery long lasted 2 and a half day if you make and recieve calls only and in regular use like calls, gaming, YouTube it will run full day."
,3,03-Nov-18,"Phone is good but you are thinking to shift from iPhone to this phone ... And you love to take pictures this is not for you... All selfie are come with some weird blurr and smoothing effect which irritateting me most otherwise back camera is good but Don't compare camera qaulity to iPhone..
... But yes one good quality is memmory and batter"
,1,29-Dec-18,I have been using the one plus 6 for last 5 month with the back cover comes along with the phone and today as opened the back cover saw that there are some spots where the colour is gone. Its not good after spending 40k if you have expierence this kind of thing. And the worst part is even after using the back cover if it happens then its not worth busying. I dont know how its with mirror black. Rest camera and sound and performance is good.
,4,24-Aug-18,Camera is yet to be improved. A dual camera must take bright pictures in low light as well. Obviously comparable features with iphone x. But budget makes the huge difference. Ram and Rom at this price are remarkable.
,5,22-Oct-18,"The best smartphone in the market in this range. No other phone beats the picture quality, battery backup, battery charging time, sound quality, or the price. OnePlus has also started giving back case covers along with the phone which is a fair quality one and can be used for long time.
Got it for Rs. 27,000 after all the discounts, so got more value for money."
,4,25-Feb-19,Great phone but battery life not that good picture quality is fine but not extra fine like some of huwai or samsung the glass makes this phone real fragile its almost impossible to use mirror black without a solid cover on it otherwise the glass can be shatter anytime soon. But overall performace like charging speed phone speed software support is just awesome. At last i think 37000 is bit overpriced for this device don't know but i still prefer my one plus 3t over 6 anytime .
,5,28-Oct-18,Picture quality is awesome battery too sound also very good quality.... Totally mobile is awesome must buy everyone
,4,18-Oct-18,"All i can say that its is a budget flagship device. It has all the required features e.g OIS, camera stability, gyroscope, portait mode, professional camera mode, average sound quality, notch, splash resistant, face unlock feature, fingerprint scanner. Battery is very very good.. no heating issue despite running multiple apps symntaneously. Rear camera is best.. howevr front one is not up to mark...processor is best for speedily performance. Design is premium. Just go for it. Best for vloggers."
,3,21-Jan-19,"My review
Working fine with games best in game mode.
Better customize OS not super.
Camera is good.
other function work with excellent.

Pros.
Original Screen Guard not available.
Call recorded audio playing in music app ( Such ridicules).
over weight."
,1,18-Dec-18,"It's not even 3 months since I have been using this phone. The device has stopped working with my Vodafone sim card but works fine with Airtel. My Vodafone sim works fine in other devices, my family members on Vodafone have no issues with Vodafone network at the same location, and the problem happens everywhere, not just a specific area. I tried all the reset and reboot options possible and even lost data from my phone. Nothing seems to be working. I will definitely not be going for a One Plus ever again after this experience."
,4,09-Oct-18,"Received this phone on the 24th October, 2018.
I was hyped when I received it. After a few days of usage... I submerged it under water. Twas my bad. Now, the screen is gone, sound clarity not as before. The phone is slow. Touchscreen not working. SIM reader affected.
My advice: FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. Just because the phone is an IP 67 rated... DO NOT RISK IT!!! I REPEAT... DO NOT RISK IT!!!
there goes my 40k phone. ??
Bought it online so... anyone knows the service centre is in NE India, please advise."
,1,02-Feb-19,"Screen flickering is heavy and it is affecting eyes. It's been 4 months of purchase and found such kind of issues from oneplus6.

Cons:
1. Screen flickering happens
2. Wifi is not strong at all
3. Battery life is okay

Either the seller is providing wrong goods or the product is defect one which is showing issues after 4 months of purchase"
,5,23-Oct-18,No doubt... It's beast... Awesome experience... So far... Superfast app loading..... It's actually fit the tagline.... The speed you need.... I m quite impressed... More dan wat i expected.... Most importantly 4 hrs of continuous pubg(HD mode and high frame rate) i played... It's quite impressing... And top up time... Dere is nothing to say about dis... Well made decision... To upgrade from oneplus 3T
,1,13-Nov-18,"I didn't like this phone. I am getting the issue related to it's battery. I didn't want to continue for this phone at all and wanna upgrade to the next version. The sound quality is also not that good, at the I time I bought it was perfect but now the sound quality is poor. Battery is draining too fast also on stopping numerous of apps and games. Also on time of playing some games I am struggled of it's battery and the phone is heated as of high. Sad to write this but this is a serious issue to me. Kindly help me. Thank"
,4,26-Jun-18,"I like the speed of this device, same as a Nexus/Pixel device. OnePlus constantly hears it's user complaints and addresses them; that's really appreciable.
However the design is not up to the expectation. Little heavier due to the massive screen."
,4,08-Sep-18,"Great phone. Before taking in hand thought would be big but is very sleek. Excellent processing. Looks very elegant. Pictures, processing, operating system all are of great quality. A good phone with sober looks. Wish pricing was little better"
,3,08-Nov-18,"Review after 2months usage. Pros- good picture quality, both cameras are excellent, sound is good. Good battery life.Cons - the apps like SBI , ICICI, food Panda taking too much time to open even after upgradation of OS. The second sim slot is not working properly. It will be active with full signal strength only but gives switched off response to other callers and for second slim slot some time OTPs will come very late. Something wrong with second sim slot. No headset will be given with purchase. Other than that very good mobile."
,5,07-Nov-18,"I like everything about this phone. I feel the rear dual camera could be made more functional with more features. Battery life is OK for moderate usage. Heavy users might find that lacking. The best part is the rapid charging facility provided by Oneplus6. It's just AWESOME!!! The UI, picture quality is too good. Just love this gadget :)
"
,5,05-Nov-18,An excellent product. You get a phone that is equivalent to any premium phones available in the market. You change the name to any one of these so called high-end phones and people will definitely not be in a position to identify.
,4,02-Dec-18,"No doubt...Good phone. I have seen couple of issues too, like print option not available in photo gallery, message app hangs up sometimes (not only for me, my friend also has same problem), etc. Probably, I don't agree to the statements that, One Plus is a Killer phone! Definitely falls in good phone segment."
,1,07-Dec-18,"The phone came in a tampered packing isnpite of saying to amazon they said u may open and when i started using in weeks time i told call cetnre ppl its seems refurbished phone and they dint offer any help. The phone goes on vibration mode an time, volume low and ringtone stops working. Phone also got hanged twice to my suprise."
,5,10-Nov-18,Bought it during the Diwali Sale. It's an excellent product from OnePlus with amazing features at an unbeatable price. Battery life is amazing and can easily stretch >1.5 days with decent usage. Bought a battery bank alongside but don't see myself using the battery bank in near future.
,4,21-Oct-18,"This is a beast. You will never regret buying OnePlus 6. Picture quality is very nice. Adaptive display is very sensitive and responds immediately to any change in external light. It has only one speaker at the bottom left but sound quality is still good.

The only thing that I wanted to be better is the battery life. The battery is enough for one day if you use the device moderately.

Design is very premium. I purchased mirror black and the back of phone is really cool."
,4,10-Oct-18,"Words aren't enough to describe how awesome this mobile is. It's very soon to give a verdict on battery life since I have been using for less than 6hrs now.
Body - Awesome feel
Display - Mind-blowing
Software - Fluid like experience
Sound - Crisp"
,5,07-Jul-18,"Speed of the processor is very good, face recognition and biometric unlocks are very fast, screen wideness is low and pic clarity not upto the mark, pic quality is not as expected, audio clarity is nice, battery backup lasts one day, net connectivity is superb, not provided a headphone,"
,5,14-Oct-18,"The speed, notch display, user-friendly features, et al are up to expectations. The build quality seems fine but could have been better as compared to Apple finish in build design. Or else, it's fine. This is Android king yet Apple is Apple."
,5,19-Oct-18,Best mobile I bought till date. Have all features what one can expect in this range.
,5,01-Nov-18,Must buy product. A little bit expensive but good in all segment like camera battery fast charging light weight. Go for it if your budget is allow.
,1,15-Oct-18,"would suggest not to buy this phone. I had purchased this phone 3 months back. Its display stopped working. Submitted the phone in gallery, firs they say, passoword issue may be, then after explaing them they say software issue, now they are saying display issue. they will replace the display. BAD QAULITY phone. #neverbuy"
,1,28-Dec-18,"Have been told that I will be getting a 10% cashback if I purchase this phone using my HDFC debit card and I have made a full payment. It's been 6 months and I haven't recieved any cashback yet. As per the bank lots of customers are facing the same issue. I feel like people are getting cheated out here.
"
,5,23-Oct-18,"This is my second oneplus device after 5t, and it has not dissapointed me.
Its premium as usual and red color is just killing any other phone in looks.
Got this phone in killing price in great indian sale 2018 under exchange of my old mobile.
Its worth every penny..as it got sold out on first day of sale.
Only con in this phone is battery is same 3300 mah as 5t.
Which could have improved, otherwise this is a beast mobile."
,5,19-Jan-19,The phone has more than enough RAM. It charges in 30 minutes flat (0 to 100 percent). The camera is fantastic and it has a great deal of storage available. I got it at a fantastic price on Amazon.
,5,07-Nov-18,"I bought this for a friend the review below is hers -
Has a wonderful in hand experience. Love the user interface and it's quirks( alarm sounds, gesture controls etc.) Multitasking is super fast. Picrure quality is fantastic. The Battery and speakers could have been better. The charging adapter is very bulky. It's mine and I love it."
,4,15-Oct-18,"Everything about the phone is awesome. Was disappointed with Amazon for taking 5 days for delivery, being a prime member. Packaging was average. Not much protection and box had some tampers.
Phone was intact. The side sound mode toggle switch is a little loose. I'm not sure if it's my phone or all phones have that.
"
,3,14-Nov-18,"This phone eventually gets slow
Sound is average due to one speaker
Picture quality is slightly above average due to over exposure
Battery life doesn’t last more than 3-4 hours continuous usage
There is nothing extraordinary
Phone is good for daily basis but if you’re thinking of comparing it iPhones then DONT iPhone Se is equally fast in gaming and sometimes faster
Thus, it’s a good phone but not for the price one plus should’ve thought before placing the price tag
"
,4,08-Oct-18,"Performance no doubt is very good
Fastest Android update after Google phones
Picture quality is good but not as expected,Front camera so so ,Back cameras should have been better.After pie update it's detiorated
Battery life after pie update has improved but still needs improvement"
,4,17-Oct-18,"Good product, been a one plus user for a while, good to see same characteristics maintained here also. No complaints about the phone as got it for a very good price.
Unfortunately delivery and buying experience has not been upto the mark. Very poor show by Amazon, seems portal doesn't even care about its customers. Probab"
,1,18-Nov-18,"Worst service ever.. the company doesnt care about its customers at all after the product has been bought.. No service for the existing customers.. Quality of the product is worst.. especially back cover.. At the first slip of the mobile, it broke even aft the back case is thr.. Its a bad quality product.. Even the service providers and company representatives (one plus showroom koramagala) say tat and accept tat.. So there is no point in buying this product.."
,2,31-Jan-19,"Worst service,, the service centre only know how to loot their customers. Battery life is not upto the mark. The durability and strenght of the phone is very less, just dropped for a single time and the screen got cracked.. Sended my phone for repair to service centre and it took 28 days just for the replacement of the display.. Worst mobile worst service ever i faced.. Dont buy this, use your money in some valuable phone who worth it."
,5,13-Oct-18,"Much improved battery life, speed and camera.
I also received Android 9.0 update.
However one plus needs to improve depth sensing photos to detect edge detection. It's way beyond what's available in the market. Otherwise it's a great quality camera."
,3,26-Nov-18,I had decided to purchase this device after a lot of positive reviews and the awesome???? quality of camera. After a day of thinking I have decided to got a 8+128 OP6. But kind of one month use I want to say that the camera of the phone is worst in the low light. I have been using samsung galaxy s8 device for the last 5 months and in comparison to that op6 is nothing in the terms of camera pictures. Rest of all its superb whether it's sound or battery etc.
,4,14-Nov-18,"Deducting a star for the brightness of the phone is just ok(which I don't expect, having gone for not best of the premium brands like Samsung etc, having spent so many).

Under the sun the brightness is far more disappointing. :(

This one thing has disappointed a lot, else by every other means the phone is awesome!"
,5,08-Nov-18,"This is a very good phone. I used OP 3 and now bought OP 6. Everything about the phone is awesome. Only complaint i have is the speaker. After 2 months, it is has some disturbance while playing music. The phone never fell down and i took good care but this is a small issue as i regularly use headphones. Otherwise there is no issue in the phone."
,1,03-Nov-18,Worst phone .worst battery back up it doesn't last for four hours also . I brought it 20 days before and its battery life is worst than iphone also.and amazon is not helping.worst customer care
,4,07-Jul-18,"amazon's delivery is quiet food.but package was not neat and tidy,even at the time of delivery,where the courierboy used to scan the barcode,it didn't recognise bcoz of the poor quality packing.

coming to mobile..
mobile is good,but the display is quiet big to handle..that makes tough to operate single hand,and even the body is slippery,be careful as it gets slipped theres chance of display breakage.., other than this the mobile is so good compared to other products at this range."
,5,18-Nov-18,"If you haven't already watched all the YouTube reviews about how amazing this phone is, go do that. I have no hesitations to recommend this product. Get it on EMI if you do not have money saved up. It is absolutely worth it."
,1,08-Nov-18,Poor quality camera worst video recording even 10k phone will give you better picture quality than this. Only thing I like is face unlock and dash charging. One plus 5 has better sound compared to this one . Good battery life till now. Before buying just compair mi 6 pro (13000) and this one (40000). MI is far better than this. I made Wong decision to buy this one.
,5,28-Sep-18,Purchased it for my mother. She is thrilled. Her first smart phone. One plus because all of us are fans of One plus... The features beat even the best phones. Pic qualities are awesome even at night…
,4,13-Oct-18,"One+ has been consistently maintaining its leadership. It does all sections well. I wish they have pure Android version also. The one problem is that the touch is too sensitive sometimes and the key board layout should be spaced out well. Often while typing fast, there is problem. Particularly the space bar and home button are too close. Otherwise, this phone is great value for money. Premium feeling all the way."
,5,09-Sep-18,"Simply the best phone.. I have been using Samsung phones till now and I must say that this is definitely the best phone in market..
Lots of things to mention.. But to keep the review short.. I would just say that this mobile is superb.."
,4,19-Nov-18,"The phone is awesome. It works amazing.
The picture quality of the camsera is truely remarkable. It is as per expected. Even after latest update, night mode working really nice.
Sound quality is ohk. It's not that much loud but it's ohk.
Game changing is battery life. If you are a normal user, then battery will last till a day. But if you are a core user, then you have to charged your phone twice a day.
Other wise it's a great phone."
,5,02-Dec-18,"I fall in love . This phone is super fast. Delay delivery but satisfied. When I unbox it I can't express that moment. Lots of joy comes out from my heart. Till now no lagging at all. Totally smooth. Box and All other accessories conditions was good, no crack at all. Basically silk white colour which is too much good. My device running with Android 9.0.2 Oxygen OS (8/128Gb). Thanks OnePlus"
,3,04-Sep-18,"Thought that with Snapdragon 845 and 8 GB RAM the phone would be great, but it hangs sometime and screen becomes non-responsive.
May be they rectify this in update."
,5,04-Feb-19,"Had OnePlus 3, and upgraded to 6. Didn't find much difference apart from few upgrades, picture quality ofcourse and big screen. Battery life is same as it was in OnePlus 3. Almost a day according to my usage, for gaming like pubg I have to charge more than twice. Overall it's a good buy with latest software updates"
